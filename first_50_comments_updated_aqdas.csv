"I know, its just harder than I thought living with my parents driving me up a wall.  When I was working; I was fine because I would literally be working 10-12 hours a day, get home, make something to eat, watch some Netflix or play video games, go to sleep, and repeat.  Not a whole lot of interactions except to organize a family movie night at a theater with my brother as well and not having it be so late for us to still go to bed and wake up the next morning at 5 or so...

Now I'm taking some online classes in computer science and business so I can hopefully learn and be able land something to be able to still work from home and making a pay check next time something like this happens.  I work for a wholesale business that delivers liquor to bars and restaurants - but when they shut down, business went down as well and we were out of a job for a week.  Luckily, our boss was also opening up 2 new stores before all this and is giving us some work to do to both help them out as well as us whenever this clears out and we can hit the ground running better prepared.  They're still going to pay us our full amount that we were getting before, just a different kind of work.  Still work.",1,0,1,

You officially rationalized intrusion. Even if it is as you say it is (it isn't), it doesn't make up for the principal of the fact. True, google's algorithms can figure out a lot. Wtf do you think the government is using?! Bringing up how bad other governments are doesn't make what the government is doing ""okay"". If anything, the government knows that keeping it's people comfortable allows them far more freedom to fuck over other countries than if they wanted to treat us like they were N.Korea.

People will fight for their fake ""freedom"" (usa) a lot harder than for an imposing government (n.korea) (staying within the confines of your examples).

This all goes much deeper, and we're hardly doing any side of the argument justice, here. If it was as you say it is, the bevy of guilty companies being mined wouldn't be as high as it is.",0,0,0,
USAA is a great choice. I worked there for two years. They don’t have the most modern or fast paced environment (banking regulations = slow) . Their technology stack is actually better than most other banks and the people who work there are pretty smart cookies. One of my former coworker could easily have worked at Google. The pay is subpar but for a first job it’s 11/10 when it comes to benefits and culture. Your manager cares about you and your coworkers always want you to grow.,0,0,1,

"Keep in mind it’s way cheaper for your A/C company to tell you there isn’t a problem and it’s just something you have to deal with than it is to send someone out and possibly find a real issue that they have to correct under warranty.

I ran into this same situation with my first new-construction home.  I I had a room that was always warmer than all the others — called the A/C company to check it out (within the first year) and they showed up with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to get different readings to tell me it was within spec.  They also threw in other nonsensical reasons like getting more sun than other rooms (even though it shared a wall with two other bedrooms that didn’t have cooling issues).  Basically they gave me a big list of reasons why they shouldn’t have to do any actual work.  Note that at no point did they even look at the unit or duct work in the attic.

  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  

It would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking “it meets specs” and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didn’t stop to consider anything else.",0,0,0,

"&gt; hiking in the open air in one of our parks.

I'm going to make the rash assumption that you are new(ish) to SA and don't realize what happens in SA parks on holidays.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLm8dukRJk4

There's no hiking, per se. It's more of a huge drunken party.  All the local parks, but mainly Breckenridge lately, become a mass of extended families pitching tents and CAMPING in the city park for the duration of the holiday, trashing the place and not picking up after themselves, which takes the city workers 2 days of cleanup.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other.  

That's the reason the parks are closed, because people can't behave and follow social distancing guidelines.   

The parks will be open again after the holiday weekend.

YouTube professor menser CompTIA Network plus and security Plus. If you're up for a really good challenge Cisco CCNA. And some routing and switching pair that with the security Plus you should be able to find a job 54k.
Public libraries will be your best friend to for good free resources and YouTube. Reddit is also another great source.

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form. 

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well. 
Check out usajobs.gov you might find a job there that you might want to try. Like the federal courts they're in San Antonio maybe they have an opening for a probation assistant it sounds like you would be qualify for or judicial assistant .
