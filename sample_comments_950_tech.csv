Clearly, you have zero desire to contribute to that in any meaningful way and are posting on reddit to try and bolster followers on your garbage can of a Facebook account.

"I work specifically in curbside for H-E-B right now, and it’s been pretty difficult for anyone else I’ve recommended to land the job. It’s also definitely way more customer-service based than just shopping around the store, I take the orders out to customers, handle phone calls, assist the store customers while I’m doing my rounds. On the other hand, I’ve suggested Instacart to two friends and in two days they had the job and a card to start shopping after applying online. As far as I know, for them they don’t have “coworkers” or a direct boss, they shop for a single order at a time (as opposed to the average of 12 I do), and they’re basically left alone in the store since they’re not an HEB employee.

The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into. Companies are going to want sample code / programs for devs, they'll want certifications for anything from project managers, to sysadmins, to account managers. 

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students. Grads are much cheaper than an experienced hire, and the companies believe they can teach you everything you'll need to know from a technology standpoint. Most of these companies are also remote work, so you're not tied down to just what's available in the area. ",,,
"Tickets can be very expensive if you’re trying to get particularly outstanding seats. It is a professional sporting event from a 5x champion team after all.

You can find cheaper tickets using reseller apps like StubHub, Gametime, or Ticketmaster.

The first chart shows numbers for the five counties with the most convictions overall. The second chart shows the same numbers for the five counties with the most convictions per capita.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",,,
"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

"Eyup. You're 100% right and here's the numbers on why:

&amp;#x200B;

It is possible to find a studio apartment in SA for about $550/month.

Minimum wage works out to about $1,160/month.

Meaning that after rent a person has $610 to pay for everything else. Food, gas, car, insurance, healthcare, phone, electricity, water, everything.

And SA is a one of the cheaper places to live.

&amp;#x200B;

It ain't avocado toast and Starbucks that's making people poor, it's low wages.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and I know it's a side issue, but I never understood how avocado toast got to be the go to example of those awful young people wasting money. A loaf of bread at HEB is about ten cents a slice, an avocado typically costs about a dollar and you can get at least four pieces of avocado toast out of each one. 

So the total cost per piece of avocado toast is about 35 cents. Two for breakfast is 70 cents. \*\*THAT\*\* is the platonic example of how wasteful young people are spending their money on frivolities? Spending less than a dollar for breakfast is bad now Boomers?",,,

"&gt; what's worse is his followers tie up the 911 lines at bexar county. They call in and report ""kidnapping"", ""assault"", and other crimes and when the dispatchers asks for the information, they cuss them out and say it's Bexar county who is the one who should be arrested. What's dumb about this is 2 things: 1) he goes to the constables office or to the smaller municipalities like Leon Valley and blames the sheriff's office and 2) they tie up the phone lines and have actual emergency calls waiting in queue while they continue to harass the dispatchers, hang up, and re-dial. Apparently his following is rather large enough that when he does these things they get hundreds of anonymous calls and death threats within hours following his arrest. The dispatchers have pretty good patience to be able to handle these calls and fortunately no one has suffered yet from the influx of 911 call abuse.

"The same user has been spamming the same contents w/ different accounts across different subreddit to promote the website. They change the wording, sometimes it's N95, R95, P100, or KN95.

N95s are a lot harder to find these days, so be aware of counterfeits or scam. [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas) released a list of N95/KN95 manufacturers that are Emergency Use Authorized (EUA).

The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) has conducted [assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html) regard to the FDA approved manufacture so you know the filtering efficiency rate. Regular mask tests cannot detect whether the mask can actually filter particles or not (water test, fire test, etc). For masks like KN95 and N95, it's better to go off with the NPPTL assessment since they have the proper equipment to test the BFE or PFE.

"A lot of people here have ideas about how reddit works but I don't think they actually spend much time looking at the subreddit rules that make reddit work and that make a lot of the subreddits what they are. 

A quick glance at some default subs will reveal that rules for submissions are the norm. 

/r/funny banes tumbler and even reddit.com. That's right, you can't link to a reddit url on /r/funny.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow. 

So the idea that reddit is all about some free market of ideas where the up and down arrows choose what is and is not displayed is demonstrably false. Just like the best news rooms have strong editorial guidelines, so must the best subreddits.

"Aww, bro, that's awful. I think I may have heard about that trial. There were a few that went down like that here in Bexar County.

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness. I've had two witnesses use earbuds so they could get answers. In one instance, we noticed a juror mute and turn off her camera. Turns out she went to work. You see all those Reddit threads complaining about ISPs? Man, connectivity issues can create chaos. As a future court reporter, you will prefer everyone be present in person, lol.

Jury selection is much faster in person and, in my experience as a seasoned trial attorney, more effective at producing a truly fair jury. My longest trial was 14 days, so 2 and a half work weeks. That involved trying offenses from the 1980s and late 2000s simultaneously. Horribly complicated case. By Zoom, it would've been a month or more. In person, we regularly finish murders in 4 or 5 days.

If you’re in the city limits you should have trash service through SAWS.  It includes garbage and recycling and an optional organics bin.  You can get compost from the program, too.   There are several “dumps” around town where you can bring bulky items, brush, etc.   

If you’re in a more rural area around town things are a bit different - C6, and Tiger Sanitation are two companies I know that do residential waste collection.  Nobody really seems happy with anyone doing that service, tho.   GVTC is a good internet provider if you’re in their area (more ‘rural’ areas outside SA, proper).

This lists the pop-up sites, including the airport days and times. The list only goes to the 28th currently, but may be updated closer to the date. I’d check a couple days before you head out. 

Worst case scenario, you arrive and Google Map HEB, Walgreens, CVS. See which one is closest, call and confirm they have availability, hop in an Uber and get vaccinated.

Put together a solid CV.  And by that I mean research and learn how to sale yourself.  You are the product.  Send it to family and friends and former co-workers/bosses to get feedback.  It is very easy to short sell yourself.  

I saw on reddit that someone got a media job by doxing themselves as a karma whore and knowing how and when to use social media.  A few weeks ago I saw a post on linkedin that they were interviewing someone that listed google as a skill.

Think of everything, and give yourself credit.  Do you just want a better paying job or do you want to work on building a career?  How can you leverage your education and experience.  Reach out on linked in to people in positions that you wish you had.  ATS sucks so networking is everything.  If you had interviews and were denied, try and figure out why.  Ask the recruiter what were your weaknesses.  Maybe there is something in your background check that you need to cleanup.

Finding a better job is now your second job.  Feel free to PM if you want.  I ended up hiring a career coach after my last layoff because people thought I was too old to do what I do.

"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",,,

"Yes, it's most highly concentrated in water vapor. But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up. Frankly I'm surprised more places aren't installing UV lights in the ducting to disinfect the air, it's a proven technology that was being slowly rolled out before this year.

"&gt; One if the best explanations I've seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8

I'll have to watch that at home. It's blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn't think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it's a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)
(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?


Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. 

There are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn't COVID related and shouldn't be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. 

Economics.  The ultimate ""facts don't care about your feelings"" subject.  :D 


Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I'm assuming you're American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it's a jobs program. 

""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we'll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". 

We have social security - it's in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I'll be lucky to never use.   I'd argue that it works, but could work better.   

If we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what's better for everyone.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",,,

"I keep seeing this sentiment come up and I don't get it. 

Obviously you guys don't compete with Austin for raw numbers of tech companies/employees, but to ignore the amount of talent and opportunity in SA is disingenuous. I don't know if people are grouping everything government into a ""government"" category rather than considering the individual areas *within* government, but you have Rackspace, USAA, an FBI field office, NSA Texas, and JBSA (DISA SATX, ARNORTH JOC, 24th USAF, 25th USAF, JIOWC, I could go on forever).

Y'all got tech and talent. Yours just supports Uncle Sam (for the most part) while Austin's does not (also for the most part).",,,

"It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it's left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn't have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don't. 

Yes, it's more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren't the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don't know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren't enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.

The answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn't an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.

Texas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?

The state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)

"Northwoods is our only sheet so ice time is somewhat limited.  There are a few leagues that are played:

* BHL is beginner league on Tuesday's which is a 10 game season that runs about $220 (about to expand to 6 teams though, and possibly a different night or an ultra late game).
* The ARL which is the ""rec league"" that plays on Wednesday/Fridays.  Unsure of season length but it will run about $20/week x duration.
* The AHL which is the competitive league that plays on Thursday/Sunday.  Also unsure of length/cost.

You get a lot of cross over in these leagues due to the limited ice time.  BHL is a newer league that the learn to play sessions were converted into b/c we had so many people.  Unfortunately for you that means you can't just come out and pay $20 for a single session like it was last year.  The shorter season cuts down on the cost a bit though.

If you are having an issue with costs reach out to Dale Henry, he is the hockey director and I'm fairly certain they will let you work out a payment plan if that is what works for you.

Depending on how busy the ice is, since it is the only sheet in town for all activities, drop-in and stick and puck times vary.  You will have to check their schedule (http://northwoodsice.maxgalaxy.net/Schedule.aspx?ID=6) to see when they are having them.  There used to be Wed drop-in but the ARL took that slot to accommodate 6 teams.

There are also a few groups of guys who will pool together and rent out private ice.  10 skaters per team plus goalies, usually for $21 each.  There are facebook groups for this.  Message me if you are interested and I can link you up with the right people, or if you have any other questions.  Always good to get new people to the rink.",,,

"The Tech community in San Antonio has gotten much better in just a few years, mainly thanks to [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com/), but we still have a long way to go to catch up to Austin.

UT Austin has one of the top 10 CS programs in the nation, so definitely go there if you get accepted even if you don't plan on staying in Austin.  I'm not sure how UTSA CS ranks nowadays, but the UTSA Cybersecurity program was named #1 in the US a couple of years ago.

The big employers here in town are USAA and Rackspace.  There's also a lot of startups based out of Geekdom, but there's definitely a a lot more tech companies both big and small in Austin.  One area where we do beat Austin is Cybersecurity.  There's a lot more talent and opportunities here if security is your thing.

Not sure about the entry level help desk opportunities, but I would highly recommend joining a few monthly meetup groups in town to network with local professionals.

Jardin’s been great with the service and all, but the last time the food was pretty mediocre and took an insane amount of time. I don’t mind a slow lunch, but we were there for almost 2 hours for appetizers and mains all ordered at the same time. 

Tre… lost major points in my book when all their pasta has started coming out salty. Took my mom and dad there for a lunch treat during restaurant weeks and ordered the wine pairing. It was a glass of wine with each of the three courses. When the waiter failed to bring out one of the glasses of wine, and we asked for it, he told me that there were only wine pairings for two of the three courses. We asked for the menus and he said it was clearly stated there were only two and walked away. Never saw the menus. Had to google their lunch time restaurant weeks menu and show him… which then prompted him to bring us that wine. Mind you- still got charged. No discount, nothing, after having to argue with the waiter. So… that and the incredibly salty pasta of late… kinda ruined it for me. And it truly was my favorite spot in town!",,,
"Think you'll dig it here!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We both like cycling (road and mtb), hiking, camping and going on weekend trips to nearby destinations.

Cycling is def covered (there is an 85-mile paved greenway that goes all over the city and it's *great*). There is great camping and hiking a short drive out of the city (esp west/northwest/north). Some *really* good day trips/weekend trips available: Austin, Fredericksburg (Texas wine country), 2-3 hours to some really solid beaches, Kerrville (folk festival, river stuff), Canyon Lake, etc.  


&gt;I enjoy gardening and history related things.

Some cool native plants that do really well here. Understand, it is *very*, very hot. We are in Hardiness Zone 8b if you want to google and see what does well here *naturally*. Other things will do fine, but know too that we are regularly under some significant watering restrictions, at least this summer. LOTS of cool history stuff here in south central Texas. The missions, Gonzalez TX, history museums, etc.  


&gt;Food.

You'll be fine. I recently found a fantastic Thai place that I'm going to give a lot of money. Amazing Mexican and BBQ, of course, and more and more upscale dining is coming to the ""cool"" parts of town (Southtown, The Pearl, etc.). The part of town you are in will matter. I'm not too far from the Medical Center and there seems to be a lot more variety over here as opposed to where you work will be located.  


&gt;We both would enjoy somewhere that is more ""greener"" and more established.

You'll find more established, large-tree lots between 410 and 1604 (north/south boundary), and I10 and Thousand Oaks (east/west boundary), and I think in your budget. There are some great parks and green spaces in the northwest and central parts of that block, and the [Howard Peak Greenway](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Parks/Linear%20Creekways/HWP%20Greenway%20Trail%20Map.pdf?ver=2022-04-21-092311-137) runs all throughout. The northwest side will start to get far from your work (it's about 25 minutes right now with no traffic), but I think it's still doable. Like you said, it's very much a car-centric city and we have a pretty solid road system.

Anyway, I'm a big fan and enjoy a lot of the same things as you and your wife. Think you could really enjoy it. Best of luck! Cheers!",,,

"Not that company, but dealt with a company similar in Houston. I didnt accecpt their offer and a few neighbors did.

Both of my side neighbors went with them, both had leaks the first rain. To top it off they threw the tiles from each neighbor over my fence on my side yard. It took a picture and bad review on their Google review to get them to come and half ass clean it up. 

One of the neighbors had an issue with their shingles ""bleeding"". It stained everything, side of house, driveway, windows, grass. Looked like a blood bath. They got outright ghosted and needed to have a new roof installed.

I'd start with the simple things, are you advertising at all? Do you work hard to determine who your first time customers are and create repeat business? (This can be as simple as handing out business cards for a free dessert or appetizer for second time guests at the end of their meal)

Are you immaculately cleaning the restaurant (including restrooms) every day, between meals and as required?

Have you considered changing the confrontational tone you take in your Google review responses?

How do you elevate your customer's experience from anywhere else? What differentiates you as a restaurant?

Have you stopped to take an objective look at whether you would pay your prices to get the food that you're cooking? Is the food prepared in such a way that the customer will *want* to come back?

"Nah.   I may upgrade when the 5s rolls around.   As it is; each OS upgrade is like a brand new phone.

I am watching the issues with the maps in OS 6...Granted they did this as Google (not a bad thing this is a predictable and they are a business) will begin monetizing access to the maps.  For x million iPhones in circulation; this will add up for Apple.  The new maps are not detailed in some spots as Google ones.

However; through sheer coincidence I installed the full Garmin app to my phone with turn by turn; which has walking, driving and public transit directions; the latter which the new maps lack.   This will affect me less; so I guess I am sort of wait and see on the OS6 but leaning toward upgrading when the download appears; for now.

I am glad to see the hind end of the ""built in cant remove"" you tube app.  I prefer the videos in the browser vs the app popping up. The current app unlike the real you tube app chooses lowest res video.

TLDR:  will look again at 5s as OS5 (and likely OS6 maybe) made it a ""new"" phone anyway.

Things like ""Microsoft Office (all ver.)"" or ""Windows and Mac Operating Systems"" are not only implied for any job that requires use of a computer, they take up space you could use to make a real impact—or better yet, keep your resume trim and to the point.

&gt;There is no need to list basic computer skills, like Word, Excel, or Outlook, on a resume.

"I currently have CPS Home Manager and have had it for about a year.  I really like it and it has saved us money because I never had a programmable thermostat before.  Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

Hope this helps!

Oh, and if you decide to go with it, send me a message 'cause I can get a referral credit.

"The Uranusians who, with all their technology and advanced societal structure, didn’t think it was cool as they were unable to deter the path of the planet sized object that impacted their home world causing the tilt. 

They had detected the object 200 years before impact. Calculated its trajectory. They knew impact was likely. 

They dedicated 2 generations (Uranusian life span is some 150 years) of their top scientific and engineering minds to prevent the problem. 

Futile effort after futile effort, the object arrived. 

As a last ditch attempt to preserve something of their people, they loaded a small spacecraft with a few people, supplies, and information regarding their society. 

They shot the spacecraft toward Sol, hoping one of the inner planets would prove hospitable enough. 

The craft reached Earth, but only after being hyper accelerated by the gravity of Jupiter. Like a rock in a sling, Jupiter whirled the craft around and shot it out directly at earth with amazing velocity. 

This craft came crashing down to Earth in the area that is now known as the Yucatán peninsula.

"&gt;The fastest we have ever come up with a vaccine is — wait for it— four years. It was for the mumps.

That was back in the 60s. Technology has advanced far more and there are several countries racing for a vaccine. It's being fast-tracked and the governments are throwing money at it along with billion dollar drug companies. 

&gt;For other viruses, like HIV, we never did come up with a vaccine.

HIV is a retrovirus that stays dormant in the body for more than a decade before it becomes active. It attacks the immune system directly so a vaccine is hard to produce.

As a younger man I did a lot of side work and consulting for different groups, but the pay was always at a lower rate than my corporate job. I've seen two replies now stating that a small scale operation should have equal compensation to the largest scale education systems. :( 

So if you were offered a position with a small church or home setting to teach only 4 children instead of 20+, you would need to make equal to a district position?  Or do you think more pay is required since you lose the TRS benefit? I understand the desire to not go backwards in your career, but the scope of work is significantly smaller, isn't it? Am I missing something major about the position I have not considered? 

One of my friends graduated a few years ago and finished her student classroom hours, but she is teaching at a church pre-school for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage. I guess I just had some wildly incorrect conclusions based off of the education friends I have on Facebook.

"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

"""H-E-B said it has expanded its multi-year deal with marketing technology and in-store customer experience provider Stratacache — an ongoing deal that provides the food retailer with greater digital insights into its customers.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, can be custom-tailored to the grocery vertical offers retailers the ability to deeply personalize online shopping experiences instead of compelling shoppers to wade through tens of thousands of possible choices.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source.

"I don't see where I said drug abuse is a new problem.  I'm in my mid 40s I have seen the change in society's behavior and it's alarming . Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.",,,

The downsides to San Antonio are far and few between, the biggest being the amount of uninsured drivers, but a solid insurance policy will protect you from that.  This is one of the few areas growing economically, the price of housing is more akin to a small town, the locals are very nice and also despise the stereotypical example of poor gang affiliated Hispanic thugs.

I have heard many parents of white boys experience bullying though, not sure why but that seems like it would be a concern of mine if I had a son.

"Robert Flores first fell in love with Fred’s Fish Fry back in high school when he used to hit the pokey little takeout joint that’s still afloat in a sea of auto parts scrapyards on Somerset Road.

Decades later, the 65-year-old still heeds the sweet siren call of Fred’s rectangular fish fillets, round shrimp pieces and their famous tartar sauce. Now, at least once a week, he and his wife hit the Fred’s at 6323 Old Pearsall Road, a downright palatial location in comparison to what will always be his seafood pride of the South Side.

“Check this out. So when I was in the military, I was gone for 14 years,” Flores said. “Where do you think the first place I went to when I came back? No lie, Fred’s Fish.”

The South and West Side institution is still dishing out the same fish and chips after more than 50 years and despite the persistent rumor that the chain is a drug front or some other criminal cover-up to explain its apparent lack of customers or cars in the parking lot. That rumor has circulated for decades and now is the basis for several memes on social media.

Why don’t you see cars in the lot? Most customers get takeout, and several locations don’t even have a dining room.

That takeout now is the stuff of San Antonio legend, a tradition carried out for generations one greasy, three-piece shrimp and fish platter-filled box at a time.

Take the Fred’s at 603 N. Zarzamora Street. In just one late afternoon hour, the West Side location saw multiple demographic groups dive in for an order of fried seafood with a heaping side of memories to-go.

Delia Gonzales, a 32-year-old mom with her 6-year-old son, proudly declared she swings by every other day and has loved the shrimp, onion rings and just about anything else at Fred’s since she was 17. Ditto Jose Gutierrez, 65, retired from the Army and the Marines who’s been a Fred’s fan through high school, Vietnam and two trips around the world.

Then there was Beatrice Perez, a 70-year-old grandmother with her 9-year-old grandson. She professed a similar love for Fred’s three-piece fish order, a love that goes back to her 20s.

“It’s a family tradition,” Gutierrez said. “ ‘Hey, let’s go to Fred’s.’ ”

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio’s Pig Stand diner has a heart that won’t quit

What started in 1963 with a single fish fry on the 4800 block of Roosevelt Avenue has quietly spawned to a school of 16 Alamo City locations, more than the number of area Long John Silver’s and Sea Island Shrimp House locations combined.

Most Fred’s takeout meals come in a basic 5- by 7-inch box with a Fred’s logo. The seafood platters — ranging from $10.05 for two fried pieces each of shrimp, oysters and white fish to $47.04 for a dozen pieces each of shrimp and fish — include tartar sauce, ketchup and bread. Prices aside, it’s been the same since pretty much the beginning.

The distinctive Fred’s sign — a gray fish leaping out of green water — has been the same since the early 1970s. And the menu still sports photos and prices of Fred’s signature fish and shrimp, still battered and breaded by the same company the Castellanos refuse to name but who they say refuses to work with anyone else.

Even the name behind the business remains relatively unchanged. The seafood legacy of late founding father Alfred Castellano Sr. and his son Alfred Castellano Jr. now carries on with Alfred Castellano III and his sister Teresa Castellano.

“I’ve got two helpers here. Well, two bosses now,” said Castellano Jr., 75. “I’m semi-retired.”

Seated in a conference room at the Fred’s main office and processing plant, just down the road from that location on Somerset, the Castellanos served up the kind of secrets to success that sound about as square as their fish fillets: Avoid the middleman, don’t get into debt and never fix what isn’t broken. The Castellanos have stuck by that simple and consistent recipe since Castellano Sr. died in 1971.

The Castellanos say they save money by buying seafood directly from fisheries and processing and distributing it themselves. They also buy and build on the property of every Fred’s location, which they own instead of lease.

And those locations, which already bear a small footprint, bear an equally small staff. The busier Fred’s restaurants may have up to four employees at a time, Castellano III said, while the tinier walk-ups have spells where they get along just fine with a single staffer.

“So when people question a lot, we’re just not splurging on stuff we don’t need,” said Castellano III, who added that such misconceptions about Fred’s are a big reason why the company doesn’t bother with social media.

“We sell a good product, and it’s all the same,” Castellano Jr. said. “All the stores you go to, it should be the same.”

On ExpressNews.com: These 6 classic San Antonio carousels take nostalgia and history by the reins

That continuity and ready nostalgia has earned more fans than drug-front speculators online. One such fan is Joel “Tatu” Herrera, the owner of Folklores Coffee House on South Flores Street, about 4 miles from Fred’s headquarters.

“(As a kid) I remember vividly on Fridays my dad would always get Fred’s Fish Fry,” Herrera said. “(For) our parents’ generation, that was the place for fried fish.”

A few years ago, he struck up a friendship with the Castellanos and toured their facility where they make the bulk of their menu items in-house. “Me being a chef, to me it’s amazing that they’ve kept up this legacy going for such a long time,” he said.

He was so impressed, he took to Facebook to promote the brand, making it the No. 7 reason to love the South Side, a clap back at the persistent drug-front stigma.

The Castellanos have heard it before, and shake their heads with a weary laugh.

“Let me tell you something,” Castellano Jr. said. “We don’t do stuff like that.”

Castellano Jr., who was a former chairman of San Antonio’s Firefighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Service Commission, said such rumors about Fred’s don’t bother him because a) only “people who are stupid” make up such stories and b) he can assure that “the police and everybody else has looked at it and checked us out, (and) we have no problems.”

The law sure seems to back him up. The San Antonio Police Department replied to an Express-News inquiry into such rumors by noting its narcotics division has no record of issues at any Fred’s Fish Fry locations.

“I think the big charm to Fred’s is when you grew up on the West Side and the South Side, that’s what you could afford,” Herrera said. “When you go to Fred’s you feel like you’re back home, all those memories and that good stuff. That’s the great thing about food, and that’s the great thing about having something consistent like them.”

That whimsical love for Fred’s also goes for its employees. Christina Stricker was 5 when she had her first Fred’s fish from the Somerset location. Now 47, she rings up such memories at many a Fred’s register, including the one on North Zarzamora.

“The fish has not changed,” Stricker said, then added with a laugh. “The atmosphere hasn’t changed.”

What will change for Fred’s is how customers can express their appreciation for the chain beyond just picking up another three-piece fish to-go.

For the first time, Fred’s will sell branded T-shirts. Those should be out in the next couple of months, just in time for Fred’s third Fiesta medal release. Fred’s also is looking into food delivery services such as Grubhub for those who’d rather reel in their orders from home or work. And they’ll have a new website soon with more food photos and information.

In the meantime, Fred’s Fish Fry looks to just keep on keeping on with the same no-frills formula that’s made it the biggest little seafood chain in San Antonio, despite one whopper of a fish tale about how they do it.

"$18.00 to $20.00 an hour, 40 hours a week, average taxes, no health insurance deduction. The way I figure expenses is $1200.00 per month rent for a 1 bedroom in a nicer area in a nicer apartment (not top of the line but comfortable).  $100 a month utilities, who knows what it will really cost but for an apartment that is not running the a/c at 70 degrees all day, maybe that's a reasonable number. $100 a month cell phone and internet, again, I don't know how much your plan will cost this is just an estimate. $400.00 a month for food from a grocery store (not including restaurants or delivery) for one person buying most of the things they want not on sale, there is no way for me to know how much you really eat. $400.00 car payment, $100 a month car insurance, again, no way for me to know how much your car payment or insurance is. $50.00 a month for incidentals (new clothes for work, a higher than normal utility bill, etc) $50.00 a month for gas, no way for me to know how much you drive.  That is $2400.00 expenses every month. $18.00 an hour is $2460 average monthly take home pay. $20.00 an hour is $2717 monthly take home.

"I think this is pretty spot on.  Around 10 years ago I had left San Antonio to go to school in Austin and at the time San Antonio couldn't hold a candle to the type of young urban life someone living in Austin could have.  

That's all changed I feel like over the last 5 years.  Even after I came back to SA after college there wasn't much to do in San Antonio.  Every bar seemed to be located in a strip mall.  Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

"It sounds reasonable on the surface, but the end result is the increasingly unsustainable level of wealth inequality in our country. When workers are atomized into individual contract signers with employers it creates a vast power imbalance.

Without any unions, you get a race to the bottom as profit-seeking drives downward pressure on wages.

The only exceptions are high skilled, high in-demand industries (like tech) where workers can get away with demanding high salaries. That's great for knowledge workers, but our society also needs janitors, gas station attendants, shelf stockers, and other roles where profit-seeking capital has driven wages below cost of living in many areas.",,,

"Obviously I'm gonna be a bit biased, but I honestly think people would enjoy it regardless of if they're into anime or not. We market as an anime convention, sure, but that's not what we're all about.

This year our theme is Fantasy/RPG, so we've got this big ticket Final Fantasy concert and related. There are a lot of people coming out for that who are interested in the franchise and/or orchestral music (https://ffnewworld.com/concert/sanjapan/). 

Speaking of music, there are a lot of people who come out for our musical guests. Entrance to Teddyloid's set and the ALL OFF concert are both included with the badge you purchase. Give 'em a listen, if you're into that.

We've got a lot of gaming content, as well! Video, board, table top, card, whatever, you name it. Not only do we have free play areas where you can enjoy things with friends (or make new ones), we've got scheduled tournaments as well. And we even have this neat retro game museum that people are free to peruse and even play a few consoles in.

Plus, I know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetups/panels (which again, aren't just restricted to anime fandoms). If you're really curious, I'd suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule (http://san-japan.org/events/schedule) to see if there are things there you might be interested in. Note that doesn't contain our gaming schedules, or the stuff that's open regularly like karaoke or the retro game museum. 

Also, there are also a lot of people who go just to enjoy/interact with/take pictures of the really awesome cosplays we get. I don't always know the fandoms, but we can all appreciate a well made cosplay. The cosplay show is wildly popular.

"I was under the impression Mayor Castro was aggressive toward courting Google.   Since he bailed to be on the President's Cabinet..../shrug.

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.

there are endless amount of places so i’d recommend the happy cow app it’s the best resource you can have. also join us over at the “happy vegan san antonio” group on facebook. we have a whole google maps thing with every restaurant in the city and what they offer. :)",,,

Since they don't have anyone identified directly as a Security-focused individual, we can probably safely assume that's going to fall into the lap of the Senior Systems Engineer (T7 pay grade ranging from 76,511.80 to 91,629.79 starting salary), or one of the random T6 roles of Network/Microsoft/Wireless Engineer with a starting salary range of 69,545.19 to 83,299.19. Those more senior roles may be few and far between, and it may actually land on the Network Engineer I &amp; II at a T4 pay grade of 53,668.20 to 64,273.59. The [job description](https://jobwebextprod.neisd.net:444/ltmprod/CandidateSelfService/) of this role seem to suggest that the person will be expected to do at least some level of security troubleshooting.

These aren't bad pay grades for System Administrators who have a locality requirement to be in the San Antonio area only, however with COVID opening up WFH options, they are not going to be competitive with the US as a whole. When you throw in Security focus as an additional requirement, you can assume that bumps up a candidate's salary expectations by at least 20-25%. 

Simply put, if they want a good security person, they're going to have to pay more. Or try to hire a very cheap CISO with the T10 director level pay.",,,

Austin is great tho! But again only if you get admitted to the college of computer science, don't go if you have to internal transfer from another major, people with 4.0s at UT aren't guaranteed transfers",,,

"Dude did you ever go to school? Do you remember what the teachers were like? Theyre bottom of the barrel and tenured in still teaching kids to duck and cover when nukes hit. Its a school. Just because your ugly kid goes there doesnt mean it suddenly becomes more valuable than any other place in america. And im glad we dont have armed police patrolling every 20 feet. Fascist ass psychos are for that. Mass shootings are a fraction of a fraction of gun violence. If you want to stop kids getting killed with guns try giving them mental health so they dont keep seeking out to kill themselves with them since suicide is the biggest risk to the american population regarding guns. So to actually answer the question, No I dont see how its a problem a person entered a place of learning. What the fuck is happening to humanity where education simply being observed for 3 minutes with a smart phone is a crime?",,,
"ATT having a partnership with google fiber? Yeah, thats not going to happen. Im sure that door salesman doesnt know jack shit. If anything happens, ATT might upgrade their shitty old copper network IF google fiber comes to town. Go fiber or go home.",,,
"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",,,

I think in the beginning, with flip phones, before cameras, the phone was banned so you don't bother other people with phone rings or actually talking.

These days, with video apps, you could say the phone ban is needed because a video call could be used by someone buying your vote and making sure you vote the way you are told. I don't know what would have happened in the past if you took a camera in the booth to photograph your ballot.

But I think the current ban on cell phones is still just a holdover about not making noise and being distracting. Laws take a long time to change.",,,
"That 26 lanes is only if you count frontage roads and ramps, which no normal person does when counting lanes on a road. Before the widening, the Katy Freeway had 3 General Purpose Lanes in each direction and 1 reversible carpool lane for a total of 7 through lanes.

First, in my experience when it comes to falls, the first question that EMT's and doctors usually ask is if the person hit their head.  So take note that those type of falls are particularly serious. 

Second, I would start documenting the date of each fall in a note on your phone.  The reason for this is that when your relative eventually has an incident and you have to talk to an EMT or a doctor in the ER, you will be able to hand them your phone and show them the relative's history at a glance.  Doctors and EMT's like this type of objective data that they can review quickly.  You can also include a list of the relative's medications.  

A lot of other people have given good advice about agencies to call, so I won't add to that.  But start building your relative's case history in your phone so you have it.",,,

"The fuck you on about ? The reason the electric Bills being so high was due to Texas being capitalist shills. In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once. But the state public utility commission also contributed by setting the ERCOT price at $9,000 per megawatt-hour and keeping it there for a week, ensuring that bills for some Texans would skyrocket.

Hand outs ? It’s not a handout when you’re being exploited by bullshit profit driven companies that looked at our situation and immediately realized how much profit they could make off people in desperate situations.

I may jumped the gun on what I was replying too but  if you think that ERCOTT isn’t recouping from this in different ways, spreading the cost out over the next years, you’re mistaken. 

My point still stands. So not only are people behind because of covid and loss of jobs, due to no fault of their own. They’ll be paying increased electrical price overall.

"Hate crimes rose significantly under Trump’s presidency, with Texas being one of the states with the most hate crimes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870%3famp=1 

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If there’s a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbi’s houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled “The Jews will not replace us” while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during Trump’s presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I can’t be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and that’s terrifying to me. 

Am I biased? Clearly. But that doesn’t make my lived experience any less real or the FBI’s data any less factual.",,,

You can also just scroll through other posts, lots of landlords post rooms to houses they own.

Shared it with 3 other random roommates but they kept to themselves except for when they were in public areas and down to vibe. Landlord also had ring cameras and a good cleaning policy :)

"Funny how you say that, since sociology is one of the fields that marxism has decided to influence most of all. Because it is a very soft science, it has been easy for them to influence. But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)

So in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google. Sure there is something to it - if someone keen on learning could never get to the library, and if there was no Internet or no book stores, maybe they would never learn anything and become what they can be. But in practice that problem hardly exists. Political measures today is mostly about throwing money away on projects that almost never generate any measurable results, just so politicians can win votes by showing how ""good"" their intentions are.

Enough about that. Again, NO, the reason why many ""homeless"" people has been seen in SA is NOT that the city is too difficult to walk in. On the contrary - criminals who have lost their driving license due to drugs and other crime will move their hustling to cities where the weather is good and it is easy to get around by walking. While people who want to work hard and get a honest career will invest whatever money they could come up with on a car and live in a city with little crime and where honesty and hard work pays off, even if the climate is hard and it is difficult to walk.",,,

"More concerts have been canceled as tensions escalate between musicians and management of the San Antonio Symphony.

“Russian Masters” on Nov. 19-20, “Beethoven’s ‘Emperor’ Concerto” on Nov. 26-27, and “Holidays at The Majestic” on Dec. 18 have all been canceled by the Symphony Society of San Antonio, the board that oversees the orchestra’s operations.

According to Symphony spokesperson Kimberly Maldonado, “San Antonio Symphony Box Office representatives will contact all ticket holders directly over the phone in the coming days to ensure they understand next steps and all ticketing options.”

Following the Sept. 27 declaration of a strike by the Musicians of the San Antonio Symphony, the season-opening concerts of Oct. 28-29 and Nov. 5-6 were also canceled, with musicians periodically leafleting and picketing outside their main performance venue, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.

The dispute deepens
---

The latest development in the ongoing dispute is a charge by the Symphony Society filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Oct. 29, alleging bad-faith bargaining by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 23, which represents the musicians in contract negotiations for the national union.

The Symphony Society’s charge follows an earlier NLRB charge filed by AFM Local 23 on Oct. 25, alleging that the Symphony Society has engaged in unfair labor practices and bad-faith bargaining. When management informed the union it was canceling musicians’ health and other benefits on Oct. 28, the union added “Repudiation/Modification of Contract” to its earlier charge.

John Ferguson, the attorney representing orchestra management, said the Symphony Society’s charge is not a counter-charge but is wholly independent of the union’s earlier charge.

“Even if the union hadn’t filed their charge, I think the symphony probably would have filed their own,” Ferguson said.

A major part of the charge alleges that the union did “not [live] up to the letter and spirit of the parties’ agreement to first attempt to use interest based bargaining,” and refused to accept mediation by Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service commissioners.

Interest-based bargaining (IBB), also known as mutual gains bargaining, is a negotiation strategy meant to avoid adversarial bargaining, opting instead for “consensus-seeking and cooperative” negotiations.

David Van Os, attorney for the musicians, said mediators present for the earlier IBB negotiation sessions showed bias toward management, in part because the musicians were not allowed to focus on the 80% pay cuts they had endured during the height of pandemic cancellations in 2020.

“When we were trying to explain the background leading up to here, one of those mediators told us that that was just all baggage and that she didn’t want to hear about it,” Van Os said.

“They want a mediator so badly, that they must think that a mediator will convince the union to agree to their demands,” he added.

‘Rocks in their head’
---

The Symphony Society charge further accuses the union of negotiating in bad faith, refusing to continue negotiations, and imposing conditions for a return to bargaining.

Van Os called the charge an attempt to deflect attention from the union’s earlier charge. “If they’re charging us in bad faith, they’ve got rocks in their head.”

The union has called for management to rescind the contract imposed on Sept. 26 before negotiations can continue. The contract matches management’s “last, best, final offer,” which reduces the number of full-time musicians in the orchestra from 71 to 42, fills 26 other positions with part-time musicians, and makes drastic wage cuts of 33% for full-timers and what union members have described as “poverty level” annual wages of $11,000 for part-timers.

Van Os said the two sides met last week for a grievance session outside the formal negotiations, and the union told management “if you will withdraw that [last, best, final offer] label … and if you will agree to rescind the unilaterally imposed conditions, we will be happy to come back to the bargaining table. But we’re not going to do it unless it’s on an equal playing field.”

Ferguson, once an attorney for the NLRB in the 1980s, said, “that’s not the way it works in bargaining. We’re not asking the union to call off their strike as a condition to return to the table.”

He said management might well be willing to move away from its last, best, final offer, but nothing can be determined until the two sides return to negotiations.

“We’ll consider all proposals … and hopefully arrive at some kind of mutually agreeable contract. Both sides are going to have to move — the Symphony realizes that they may have to move from their last best and final. … They may very well move. But we won’t know that until we get to the table and negotiate.”

The law is clear, Ferguson said. “You can’t condition bargaining.”

Ferguson said the imposed contract applies only to the third year of the original three-year contract negotiated in 2019 and does not bear on future contracts. But Van Os said agreeing to the imposed contract terms for even the remainder of the 2021-2022 season would prove disastrous for the symphony.

“We believe that we would never be able to get the symphony to get off of them if we agreed to them. They are completely intolerable. They will destroy the San Antonio symphony,” Van Os said. “And it looks to me like right now, the board is trying to destroy the symphony. This is their doing, and it will be their historical legacy.”",,,

- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps

Also, Waze only gets better the more people use it. Even more accurate traffic data (Though its very good as it is), and faster updates for road closures and reopenings, accidents, etc.  
  
Also, I LOVE when people give me delivery notes ""My address isnt in GPS so turn here, exit here, go X etc...."" I just put the address in Waze and 90% of the time at very least the road has been mapped, if not the individual house number too.

St. Benedict on the east side had a priest who was known for LGBT ministry before his death in 2016. It's worth taking a visit to see if that tone has lived on.

"Cristina's Jewelry in Castle Hills. Old school San Antonio family for generations. Inside Loop 410 at the Blanco Junction shopping center. Always fair.

I've never sold there, only bought - but I've witnessed many a transaction and have known the family since 2000. If you come in person, they are kind enough to tell you what your items are worth in the current market and why. They have always been about repeat business and building relationships. They respect your time.

Just be careful you don't spend the money you get for your gold/diamonds then and there. The place is stocked with treasures - art that has appraised value; antique furniture, carpets, lamps, glass, vases, depression glass, crystal in all sizes and shapes, chandeliers; Icons; old stained glass windows and tiffany lamps; signed native american turquoise with some pieces over a hundred years old, etc... They are willing to work with you on payment and prices. Their word and handshake mean something.

They also employ a smith who can work on any kind of stone or metal - so repairs, modification, or fabrication are all possible.  Perhaps change your ring into something new and cool? All for a fair price and in a timely fashion.

Ask for Quinn. His masters is in Art History and he used to teach at UTSA before taking on the business full time with his mother after his father passed a few years ago. 

Check out their facebook, but don't be intimidated by how nice the photos and items are. Hint: Bargain hard. Everyone from bartenders to taxi drivers to chefs to judges to politicians to pro athletes shop, hang out and sell there.

"Since I cover video games on my site, [cheap plug](http://original-gamer.com/), I've met up with some local developers. Like others have said, there isn't much. It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go. 

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies. 

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store. 

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!

First of all, I recommend /r/recruitinghell just so you don't feel all alone.  It's not super active, but sometimes it is nice to know other people are dealing with the same game.  \[Edit\] sub to /r/excel and learn everything you can

Second, get someone to practice interviewing with and have at least one person review your CV.  Talk to classmates (or anyone that you have worked with) and ask them to describe what was good about working with you.  Try to take those and create a blurb about what you bring to the table.

Third, linkedin is your friend.  Click the search box and then click all filters and narrow your search down.  After you find interesting companies/positions, search for people in accounting jobs there.  Ideally find something in common with someone and contact them.  If they are in hiring positions (controller/manager/cfo) say something like ""even though you aren't hiring entry level right now, I would like to have a 5 minute phone conversation to see if my skills might be of use to you in the future and also if I would be a good fit in the culture.""  Even really busy people are often willing to take 5 minutes to help someone out.  Also, be active.  Not like spam active, but like things that are relevant, comment where you have something intelligent say.  It moves you up the chain and increases your views.

Fourth, learn area codes in India and just swipe left on all those.

There is a generator that pumps a signal through a wire underground  A receiving wand is waved over the ground attempting to pick up the signal being pumped into the ground to find the path of the wire.

My understanding is that this equipment can be used to find buried phone lines, pipes  and fiberoptic (If a tracer line was also installed with it)  and the depth of the buried item.

I have an old locator that I think works, but it' s not a pretty piece of machinery, and a newer one that was not used much- yet still an older model.  They have been sitting in the garage for years.

My husband wanted to go into locating for himself, but never got around to it.

There is also another wand that is used to detect metal, but it's just a wand and does not have a transmitter  (and is not the same type of equipment  as the transmitter/ receiver combo)

"I've had both Spectrum and upgraded now to Google Fiber since they became available a few months ago. I've had two failures with Google so far - one which was just a few minutes, one which was a few hours - both which were automatically credited for downtime. I was one of the first homes in my neighborhood to get it, so it's quite possible that they accidentally cut through something or plugged something in that they shouldn't have on another block. Since then, no outages.

Slowdowns and lagging does happen from time to time, but it's honestly hard to say if it's a Google thing or a YouTube thing. It's definitely not constant. I will also say that in my neighborhood, Spectrum had gotten a lot better. They were rock solid for the past two or three years. I currently pay for both Google and Spectrum (on their lowest tier) and use Spectrum as my failover, in case Google Fiber does have an extended outage. I had heard from my friends near the Medical Center and over in Austin that Google is great as long as they don't have a network problem - and if that happens, they can be out for days.

"Toll roads are safer to travel with high speeds because the majority of traffic is flowing at 1 speed. Because people who take the toll roads are literally paying to get places faster. 85mph is not safe when the majority of people around you are going 65. 

Guess what? Assume everyone in the left lane travels at 90mph and all the right lanes travel at 65mph. Eventually you’re going to have to get over and exit 9 times out of 10. When is it safe to merge into a lane that’s going 20-30 mph slower than you? Especially without drastically slowing down traffic in “the fast lane”. It doesn’t work. 

Automotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. That’s not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesn’t mean you’re immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldn’t be bothered to have just left earlier. 

I will say that there are some roads that are designed to have people driving at those higher speeds, the majority of San Antonio roads are not those roads. Especially near loops, highway interchanges, and exits. They’re designed to slow down traffic before merging with other traffic. In most cases, this will happen in the right lanes.

" Well, the idea is not that everyone could walk, bike, or take a scooter, but that by allowing more people to walk, bike, take the bus, etc, it alleviates traffic and encourages dense communities vs sprawl. 

Definitely not impossible. I remember some people from the office of sustainability came to my urban planning class in college, they had a million ideas to improve things. Problem is that implementation is quashed by business, state government, NIMBYs, etc. 

I think it's naive to say that SA will ever have fewer drivers than other forms of commuters, but it is definitely possible to improve things.

You should do some research, for instance super blocks in Barcelona. There are other countries tackling similar problems and doing it well. I think part of the solution is dispelling the idea that public transportation inherently has to work to get people to and from every corner of the city. I live downtown. I have no reason to see the 80 millionth taco bell that just opened up next to a new subdivision. Creating walkable districts  with a few connecting routes to get to other areas of the city could be a great compromise. If we encourage businesses to move back downtown, that creates an easy way to move lots of people to and from their place of work along central arteries.

"So are you saying that a misdemeanor doesn't involve braking any laws?    
So you have undocumented and documented aliens?   
I mean they are trying to stay here, so wouldn't you consider them immigrants?  
And if they had a visa, aren't they documented but as they didn't leave wouldn't this make them illegal?   
    
Why do you try so badly to describe their illegal stay as not being illegal immigrants even that this is what is happening?   
   
And it's quite interesting how you tell us over and over again that no law was broken. Are you saying that there are no laws at all, I mean when I google immigration laws, Google gives me plenty of them, so I would imagine that they have to break plenty of them.   
    
Have you talked with legal immigrants that actually did it the right way how they feel, when you want illegal immigrants become legal for free?

Just a reminder, vote Democrat in November and sky high prices for everything is what they assume you want.  They constantly talk about getting rid of petroleum with no viable alternative on the horizon.  Crazy high prices are the result when fuel costs almost triple.

They're starting to talk about getting rid of the ""Trump tax cuts"".  Ignore the media lies about ""tax cuts for the rich"" and look at your personal tax returns and taxes paid over the past 5 years.  I now pay around $4k less in taxes as an independent contractor making average household income after the tax cuts passed.

The end goal of the Establishment's inflationary policy is obvious to those who pay attention, ruin the dollar to get us on the same Blockchain Central Bank Digital Currency that nearly every other country's oligarchy is currently working towards together.  This would signal the end of freedom and usher in absolute technocratic fascism where the government would be able to limit your purchases based on how they want you to think and act.  We are so very close to the precipice and they think they are so very sneaky, but this path is plain as day and has been for a few years now.

The top Republicans are scumbags who want this end too, but they won't act as quickly to get there because they seem to not have the same level of audacity to spit in their voters' faces and gaslight them about things they say they do want they actually do the opposite.

Learn about these things, don't take my word for it.  And don't use Google (or DuckDuckGo) if you don't want the CIA's official propaganda.  Again, this sounds crazy but take 10 seconds to look and your eyes will start opening.

"So for about two weeks service dropped intermittently during the day, sometimes it would be fixed power cycling the fiber Jack which itself is annoying and eventually that wouldn’t work. I had 3 tech visits during that time. One tech I had 2x and he was just defeated, my neighbor 2 houses down was having the same issue, he said he’s been having the same service call for the same problem during the last month, the most he’s ever had in the 4 years he’s been with GF. I have no clue what they did, but my internet is holding steady now however the light on my fiber Jack is still blinking blue and hasn’t turned solid in almost a month. He said this is the common issue that’s happening around San Antonio. It’s frustrating for the techs themselves because this issue isn’t an in home issue, but a backend issue. We ended up getting Spectrum as a secondary during this time and then they dropped the ball on us too -_-, that’s another story for another time. But anyway, it’s stupid that they are not communicating this with their techs, their techs know it, they know they can’t do much and yet they get scheduled for the appointments.

"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. ",,,
"Hi. I’m a defense attorney and I handle these cases all the time. Happy to advise or even do the work for you for a small fee. 

Are you over the age of 25? If you are not; you will have to take the driver safety course no matter what. If you are above 25 you have some other options. 

You can request the driver safety course. Supposedly you can do that online but I haven’t had much success getting that to work. 

You can also request deferred disposition. You will pay a slightly higher fine but not have to take the class. 

You can also set the case for trial if you want. About half the time the officer won’t show up and if that happens you get the ticket dismissed. To do this you need to go to the municipal court (401 south frio) several times. I don’t think it is worth it, but others do.

"From the E-N:

By Richard Webner, Staff WriterAugust 4, 2016 Updated: August 4, 2016 11:04pm

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio’s City Council approved a request Thursday from the property’s current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

“It’s a brand with global cache, and it’s one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,” said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg’s office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla’s presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company’s electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer’s recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn’t respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

“It’s a corridor that’s accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,” Nirenberg said. It is “one of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.”

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of “Tesla in Texas,” which touts the company’s position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe’s cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

Who will also pay it to someone else. Who will also pay it to someone else.

Apparently if you follow the links long enough all the money will eventually end up at (surprise) a couple of the big banks.

So not one single person actually involved in generating electricity, supplying fuel for electricity, or distributing electricity will be profiting by the insane rate hike, it all goes to a bunch of billionaires who do nothing but trade stocks.

And Abbott is too much a believer in aristocracy and the right of billionaires to steal from us that he won't call it price gouging and nullify it.

No one spent a bunch of resources that have to be paid for, it's not like there's some actual physical, real world, debt that needs to be paid. It's purely imaginary. Some numbers in a computer changed a little, no one got more or less electricity, but somehow we all owe some very, very, very rich people a fuckton of money.

And no one seems to be suing over this?",,,

"My two cents. Take with a grain of salt because I've only lived here for about a year.

Unique: I moved here from Austin and was immediately struck by how much more history is apparent here. For context, San Antonio will celebrate its 300th anniversary this year at Fiesta. The Spanish Missions predate the American revolution by a couple generations. In contrast, everything in Austin feels bright and new -- part of its ""weird"", progressive, and tech-oriented culture. I don't mean that in a negative sense -- Austin's a fun town, but San Antonio feels much older than just about anywhere else in Texas. It's one of the things I've come to love about it.

Pros: Great museums and parks, cost of living is low (for now), lots of space, small town feel in a big city

Cons: Segregation, ""old money"", and abysmal funding for public education. IMHO, these go hand in hand, as property taxes determine how well (or poorly) local schools get funded. This effectively makes public schools like Alamo Heights ISD the equivalent of a private school, as families who want to send their kids to those programs have to afford a home in the ISD (a quick search will show you that houses in ""desirable"" ISDs tend to be much more expensive than those in the San Antonio ISD). 

Changes: Growth, and with it, gentrification. Most of the development seems to be on the north side of the city, though some efforts are being made to revitalize downtown. It wouldn't surprise me if more people start to look here as Austin becomes more and more expensive.

Passion: Spurs, big military community, Mexican culture, Bill Millers and Whataburger, Fiesta

Staple Dishes: Chili con carne, Tex-mex and ""interior"" Mexican food, some barbecue (though more of an emphasis on barbacoa). There's an interesting and insightful article/essay on how this plays out into the cultural differences between San Antonio and Austin here: https://endofaustin.com/2016/09/22/breakfast-taco-wars-race-history-and-food-in-austin-and-san-antonio/

Food Scene: Becoming more eclectic and ""modernized"" to attract and serve a growing young professional / ""hipster"" population. The Pearl houses a Culinary Institute of America campus that has been turning out excellent chefs who want to introduce new restaurants and shops in the city. Cured is one of the more famous newer spots in the city -- the head chef was nominated for a James Beard award. Lots of local favorites for tacos, from the more ""Austin"" style (Torchy's Tacos) to more traditional Mexican (Taquitos on West Ave).

"&gt; This is just on facebook too.  Many of ""people"" that Trumpheads or affiliated groups were communicating with on Twitter turned out to be state sponsored bots.

You’re talking about propaganda, which isn’t a new concept and isn’t one-sided.

Anyone and any organization can (and does) use social media to advance their agenda.

&gt;Well the number of apprehensions being made at the border is actually at an all time low.

You’re basing that on old information that was being thrown around back in January.

Apprehensions have increased dramatically since then.

&gt;However in the past anyone who was caught at the border or immigrants caught within the United States, were quickly processed and released. 

Those who didn’t claim asylum were quickly deported.

&gt;Trump is now holding more of them.  With more of the immigrants being held, we're running out of places to put them.

That’s not quite accurate.  More are being apprehended at the border then in the past and it takes time to process their asylum claims, which requires the manpower to do so.

Either way, the assailant is fucked. The Internet never forgets. His shit-for-brains actions cost him whatever future he had. Given his prior arrest record, that means his employability now is nil.

"&gt; TIL Dan Cook created that saying.

not according to wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Cook

He first said the phrase ""the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings"" on a 1978 newscast discussing the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets. The phrase was then attributed to Bullets coach Dick Motta, who had borrowed it during Washington's successful 1978 title run.[7]

The Yale Book of Quotations later concluded that it first appeared in print in 1976, attributed to Texas Tech sports information director Ralph Carpenter, and was a variation on an old Southern saying.[1]",,,

Thanks for all the information Guys I really appreciate it. I looked on google the route from around the 410 loop to new braunfels because I plane on staying with Walmart because the 3 day schedule and pay. I currently drive 45 mins to work now so it’s actually a shorter drive. My schedule is 6am-630pm so I am usually up and leaving around 4:30am (I like to be to work early) so I think mostly anywhere traffic wouldn’t be such an issue at that time. My girl and I have talked it over and she supports my move. I knew we are young but I’m fully committed as she is (almost 2 years together). I’m probably not an average 19 year old as five been through a lot in my life. I think everything will be ok when I move (moving from Delaware lol) just as long as I have the money and job. I plan on keeping my job and and just getting an easy part time job there which you can get anywhere for extra income.  I don’t need any nice apartment just as long as it’s not trashy ya know she’s checked over there around the 410 loop and said some prices can be from 650-900 for 1/2 br which I find reasonable depending on how nice it is. I plan on visiting before I come sometime in spring when I get my tax returns. She says the river walk and zoo are nice to visit there. I’m from a small town so adjusting probably will happen. My school had barely under 1k students and my graduating lads was like 220. Probably never will have seen someone from Delaware out there or Delaware tags. Can’t wait to see the reactions. With all that said thanks for all the help and information I really appreciate! I’ve been wanting to ask some people about it from there but don’t know a single person there lol.

It limits the speed to 20mph or so and prevents anyone from changing settings (e.g. enabling cheetah mode). Not sure when this was taken, and not sure if it wasn't an available feature on this person's Tesla for whatever reason.

Either way, hope that valet driver gets canned and I hope the company he works for pays for a new car. If the car had cheetah mode, it means the vehicle is one of the higher end models that STARTS at 60k+.",,,

"Maybe you just moved in to my neighborhood.  We're 94 homes I think.  $120/quarter plus a $400 road assessment fee.  No amenities other than a gate.  So that's $880/yr.

Seemed expensive to me so I ran for the HOA board and now that I'm on the board seeing the expenses, basically shits expensive.

Stupid landscaping is about $1600/month cause we have to mow &amp; maintain grass that's behind half the homes fences along a main road.  Kind of silly.

We've got some kind of drainage pond and that cost is another $400/month to maintain.

Then there's security cameras, which has to have internet service, so there's another $50/month.

And the stupid gate itself, you know how people can call you on that gate?  Well that means it has to have phone service, so that's basically another $50/month.

And the street lamps need power, so does the gate, and the security cams, so that's another $50/month in electricity.

Then we've got to get the common area trees trimmed, but that has to be done by a certified arborist so that's another whatever the hell that costs.

I'm sure you're heard about how AT&amp;T is doing away with 3G, well our stupid gate system for some reason only works with AT&amp;T and wouldn't work after the 3G goes away so we have to upgrade that damn thing which cost us about $2k.  Got 3 different places to quote it and $2k was the best we could do.  


And on top of all of that we use some property management company to handle all the petty bullshit above, and I think that's something like $400-600/month.

"Not sure why this isn’t on more peoples radars. I am a hardcore weather nerd who likes to look at the different computer model runs when there’s fun/scary weather approaching. The most commonly used models for forecasting (“Euro”, GFS, ICON, GEM) are in almost universal alignment  for a significant ice event starting Wednesday night around midnight and persisting till about 10am the next morning. The affected area will basically be everything from south of San Antonio to Austin. Also concern that we might not get above freezing on Thursday which would allow ice to persist. 

Some of the other weather nerds think there is a high likelihood of it occurring. I imagine local news/weather will wait until Monday before sounding the general warnings. It’s early for making any real forecast about what might happen but it’s jarring to see the models in alignment like this. Last weeks’ event had the models all over the place. Which I think is more typical.

"I’d guess there is a fair percentage of rejections that could be from ATS’s, but a lot depends on the industry, companies and roles you’re applying to/for.

I’m in the tech industry and applied to medium to larger businesses which I’d expect to have ATSs in their hiring processes. I definitely received plenty of rejections but to be fair it’s way easier to submit more resumes these days.

Additionally, positions for fully remote are way more competitive. This might also impact the amount of denials.

I’m not sure about paying someone to optimize your resume. I would recommend tailoring your resumes for the roles you’re applying to and definitely include keywords that align with the position. This means having several versions of resumes that highlight your experience and knowledge for the desired role.

"CPS definitely won't finish up that new nuclear plant...that project has long been cancelled.  Even after this event, nobody wants to be stuck selling $120/MWh cost electricity into a $30/MWh market.

I'm not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would've hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn't care what the cost of production is, it's only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.

I love nuclear plants, they're an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \* 72 hrs \* $9,000/MWh = \~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.",,,

"I think there *are* a couple of differences,

- This post is about an employer imposing this rule, not the government. It's an 'at will' employment state. Their company, their choice... they can fire you for any or no reason at all. They can probably do lots of things that the workers may not like.
- Vaccines aren't *just* about your body, you can harbor the disease, grow it in your body, allow it to mutate, and then spread it to others. So it's more like... your safety, my choice. 

I get the whole, its not as thoroughly vetted as other things... but the tech has been so heavily researched, and it has been quite rigorously tested. The real concern is that this artifically made virus seems very prone to mutating for the worse, and if we simply let it keep moving around, it *will* continue to mutate, and it will likely continue to get worse. and worse, and maybe it won't stay just 0.01% mortality rate.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on the eradication threshold.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure: cases go to zero for a sustained period.",,,

"&gt; People love to blame our politicians for not giving us the proper restrictions, but I and most reasonably responsible people I know, including basically my entire family, have self-quarantined, worn masks in public, and kept up with social distancing since before anyone was really ordering restrictions.

Congratulations. Now remember that 1/6 San Antonians (25yo or older) dropped out of high school. Only 1/3 ever finished college. We're [pretty close to the bottom](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2014/02/san-antonio-ranks-near-the-bottom-in-national.html) of educational attainment.

So you figure some dude with only a high school diploma is wondering what to do in a pandemic. He can google random shit and maybe he'll find a trustworthy site; maybe not. Did he ever learn how to do that?

The President isn't wearing a mask. Neither is the Vice President. What's he supposed to do? Copy the most powerful people in the country I suppose.

Like it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy. Or maybe they just listen to the President because ""he has all the info he needs.""

"Very well said!  I still have high hope for San Antonio and think that it's an untapped market for high tech sectors and businesses.  The problem is attracting those types of businesses.

I mean, for f*ck sake, the Air Force has a very strong cyber intelligence community here and you would think there would be more companies taking advantage of that.

We don't necessarily have a high-tech corridor and there needs to be one developed.  Downtown is a tourist attraction but it also has a lot of buildings that aren't being used but can be used to attract new technology start-ups there by the city.

The city needs to basically do everything within their power to attract Google here (especially for Google Fiber).  It needs to provide incentives for start-ups to call San Antonio home.  It needs to take advantage of technology that is going to change the world in the next 5-10 years.

One of these is 3D printing.  Many companies are starting out but 3D printing is going to be a game changer for our society.

There are so many opportunities for the city government to pursue but it equates bringing a company that will hire hundreds at low-paying jobs as success versus a company that will hire 30-50 but at much much higher wages.",,,

"I’d still go cat6 just for the lower s/n ratio. It’s possible they’ve done a building fiber with a router that’s sending cat5 cable to carry the “fiber” to each unit. I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. You’re still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels you’re using. All in all there are lots of reasons it could be underperforming. If you’re using a VPN that’s also a factor (although I wouldn’t use a VPN just to test speed). Hope that helps..",,,

"Yep.  It does nothing to actually diagnose and solve the problem.  Having a lay person do those things gives the potential for them to seriously damage the coil.  Changing the filter is never a really bad idea if it needs changing BUT unless it is completely clogged with crap it's not going to make that big a difference.

Also, what is on the coil?  Is it dirt?  That implies a bigger problem if it's dirt and dust buildup.  A problem with the ducts.  Is it growth they are cleaning off?  If so it's going to be back and it's probably permeated every single part of that HVAC system ( including the ducts and their home ).  That requires a whole slew of other things to actually fix the problem.

Two reasons to ice up.  Low on refrigerant and bad airflow.  Two reasons for low refrigerant is a leak or not charged up right to begin with ( how old is the system? ).  Bad airflow is usually a fan problem but can be (rarely) an obstruction problem.

In no way does cleaning the coil and/or changing the filter going to fix those problems and there is a huge possibility that they damage the coil trying to clean it which means big bucks.

The best thing to do is call a professional and find out what the real problem is.  It should take a competent tech about 20 minutes to give a system a once over and another 15-20 to check the refrigerant levels.  In an hour a competent tech can tell you exactly what's wrong.

Call a professional.  Also, sign up for a maintenance plan.  At a minimum they will come out every year ( some do twice a year ) and clean your outdoor coil, check all the electrical systems, check airflow, and give you a list of things that are

A) immediate needs

B) near future needs

C) optional improvements to your system

The company I worked for also gave a free leak test if the system was low and they were on a maintenance plan.  This way we could identify the problem early and get it handled before it went from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing I did when my wife and I bought our house in 2019 was install a good filtration system ( the 1 inch filters are complete dogshit ) that uses 3 inch filters that are replaced once a year ( google aprilaire ) and a complete UV system to destroy anything that might grow inside the system.  Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.  Other than regular maintenance costs ( replacing bulbs/filters etc ) our systems will be going strong for a good bit longer than the average 11-12 years in our climate.",,,

There was a problem, though. Duncan never agreed to be photographed holding the sign or to endorse Elder, an agent at Keller Williams in San Antonio.

Duncan now is suing Elder, Keller Williams and some other parties alleging misappropriation of the retired basketball player’s name and image. The suit, filed in Bexar County District Court on Friday, seeks unspecified financial and punitive damages.

“It was just so blatant and so shameless,” said Michael D. Bernard, a lawyer for Duncan and former San Antonio city attorney. “We don’t want people to think this is OK or that it goes unnoticed, because it doesn’t. There is a consequence to it.”

Elder referred questions to Jack Hawthorne, general counsel for Keller Williams in San Antonio. Hawthorne declined to comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.""",,,

Dubai brings in Indonesian labor mostly.  The recruiters who bring them, typically take away their passports, force them to work, and house them in the shittiest conditions.

"Mandatory body cams, we have the technology.

"Hey there. I'm a current student and I run the news outlet, so I can give you pretty much everything you need to know. 

First off, the university is spread out over two campuses.  Main campus is 410 and S Zarzamora while the other campus is at Brooks City Base. The Main Campus is where you have mainly the College of Arts and Sciences classes (Biology, communication, English, etc). Over at Brooks City Base is where the College of Business is and that includes the various degres sin computers. Depending on your major/minor, that could mean you'll stay only at one campus or you may have to commute between the two, which takes about 20 minutes. 

Right now there are about 4500 students, with an average age of 30, but that changes in the fall. The university is enrolling freshmen and sophomores for the time, so it'll be an addition 600 students in the fall. 

That said, some of the courses for your major or to get a degree may require you to take classes at one of the Alamo College. Good thing is that TAMUSA will let almost any class transfer because they want more students. 

As for your other questions:

- The university is not ""well respected"" because a lot of people don't even know it exists. Prior to it having a campus, TAMUSA was actually in other buildings across the city. 

- The area of town is fairly empty right now. The nearest house is about a mile away from the actual university. In fact, the university is surrounded by a ranch where horses and cows graze and you'll see the occasional road runner or wild pig.

- Depending on your major, TAMUSA may or may not be the best. I know that our journalism program is on par with anyone else in the city and climbing fast to compete with the mainstays in Texas. Thing is, right now it's not much of a college ""experience"" that I wish some of the younger people would have. It'll get there in the coming years when they have dorms and eventually sports teams, but that's a long ways off. For nontraditional students like me, it's a great way to just get that damn degree without a fuss. 

- The student body is almost entirely from San Antonio, mainly Hispanic. The largest number of students actually come from the northwest side where Northwest Vista is at. There's also a lot of military who mainly make up the non-San Antonio students. I know that the freshmen/sophomore students in the fall will come from more parts of Texas. 

- As of right now there are no dorms and there's not really an apartment complex nearby. Starting in the fall, the university will try and get students into the Tobin Lofts near San Antonio College, but I would avoid that place like the plague because of all the crime that goes on there. You're best bet is searching out a good apartment and just deal with the commute. 

- Since there's not much around the main campus, there's not much to do. A lot of groups hold events at the campus, but since a lot of students commute as well as have jobs and kids, not many stick around for those events. 

So yeah, that's most of what you asked, but feel free to ask more. ",,,

"Wife should be charged with murder as well, but I suppose that somebody has to watch over her children. Note how she doesn’t utter one sentence accepting responsibility for her negligence. “Oh, my husband!” “Oh, my children!” Guess what. If you have dogs that act aggressively regardless of how you’ve bothered to train or treat them and still decide to keep them, ANY incident that occurs as a result of your dog is your fault. Period. I’m sick of the, “oh, I just made one mistake and this happened!” or “we were taking the steps recommended :(“ sob stories - if all it takes is a human slip-up for your dog to literally kill a person, you shouldn’t own the dog, and to be totally frank, your dog should not exist. 

Also, owner’s Facebook tells a radically different story. These dogs were ROUTINE escape artists, and yet no effort was ever made to modify that pathetic excuse for a fence. She addresses the attempts lazily and even appears to find them vaguely funny. She feels sad because she’s shunned by her neighbors? How many times do you think her neighbors came to her because they were being terrorized by her pack? How many times do you think she laughed at their concerns while defending her dogs claiming “they’re just the sweetest babes!” and “they wouldn’t hurt a fly!” It’s only fair she gets to feel one sliver of the discomfort that they felt.

My biggest concern lies with the fact their most aggressive dog (Snow, the white dog whose jaws are pink because of how much blood is on them) had NINE puppies. Nine pups directly descended from a genetically unstable killer monstrosity that need to be humanely destroyed before they reach maturity, and yet from the way that she speaks, it sounds like she’s already sold a decent amount of them. I seriously doubt their new owners will be informed of what exactly it is they own until it’s too late. More tragedy on the horizon. 

ACS also deserves a lawsuit, but husband deserves to be hit with the full brunt of his charges. Make an example of him so that maybe, finally, people will be forced to take responsibility for their aggressive dogs. Years of doing nothing or fining the owners pathetic fees have led to this tragedy occurring.",,,

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on the eradication threshold within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure: cases go to zero for a sustained period.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",,,

"I was actually there when this happened. My girlfriend, daughter and two year old granddaughter went to San Antonio for spring break. The baby wasn’t feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I’m an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I’ve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell. It’s strange how your mind works when your senses are overwhelmed by adrenaline. I knew that we were far enough away that we were safe. I looked upwards to see if power lines were in the tree limbs and I jumped in front of the stroller to make sure the baby wouldn’t be injured by fleeing people. I also remember having the irrelevant thought that “it’s not even that windy”. When the tree actually impacted, it was chaos. I heard a woman screaming. What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word “baby”. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I’m not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn’t something I’m good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I’m so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children’s backpacks right next to it. I looked for a few more minutes and thankfully didn’t find anyone. As I navigated my way out, I administered another cursing over-you guessed it, power lines. This time to a guest who told me to stay away from them. If you’ve watched the video, I’m the guy with the  gray ponytail. It turned out, that the family who was injured, lives a few miles away from me. I don’t know them but the mother works in a school cafeteria. I mention this because that should make it obvious that she isn’t wealthy. If you can help, please do. There is a Go Fund Me page. I don’t want to invade the families privacy so you can find it on your own if you look. We left the zoo immediately afterwards. On the drive home I looked at the news. Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a “limb” had fallen. They also reported that the zoo’s EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn’t at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though. I hope that samples of the affected area of that tree were preserved and I hope that other guests got plenty of pics of the tree. I didn’t think to take any.",,,

Sprint wasn't fast, but I mostly blame CDMA and the Treo; cell service was fantastic and I always had full bars. Customer service with Sprint is HORRIBLE, and one of the reasons I left (besides the 3GS).

If you're going 4S, I recommend AT&amp;T for HSPA+ (pseudo 4G, more like 3.5G). CDMA just isn't as good, and I have a feeling Sprint's network will be slower based on multiple reports I've looked at.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

Unlimited is great, so long as its usable. Just try out one and if you get bad service, return it while you can. If you're signing a contract; just get a 5. :)

"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not. 

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things. 

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student. 

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice. 

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time. ",,,

"So here is their [pricing](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/2657118?hl=en).

I'm thrilled, but as someone who is on a strict budget, I was interested in how much Google Fiber might be. 

For the lazy: 

Google Fiber comes in three flavors: Gig, Gig with TV, and free.

Gig, or 1Gbps, is $70 month in the Kansas City area and Provo.

The free version is free for seven years after you pay a one time construction fee, which is different in each city apparently (makes sense).

1. $300 in KC (paid once or broken up into twelve payments) 

2. $30 in Provo. 

Plus local taxes and fees.

I hope we end up paying a fee more like $30 and not $300. I expect we will because a lot of the infrastructure is already built.


That got me really excited, but I wondered how fast the free version is. I didn't see this information on the GF web site, but a Google search turned up a video from a KC GF free version user. He reports consistent speeds of 5 Mbps. [Video here](http://youtu.be/5eVWcPLHa9g)

I'm not sure if that will be fast enough for my husband and I to browse the Internet via wifi at the same time, which we like to do sometimes. 

I'm happy to take turns or come up with approximately $18 more per month than we pay now. Wow. Typing that out drives home how awesome this is.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for.

Let's be honest with ourselves: unless we're some big data engineer/scientist, we want faster Internet for ultraHD Game of Thrones streams and so we can pirate an episode of the Daily Show in two seconds off Usenet.

I could get behind an argument saying poors only have access to dialup and we need to get them some kind of bandwidth, absolutely—that really is a digital divide. You can't do MOOCs, e.g., with dialup. But an upgrade from cable to fiber isn't going to give you a leg up in the economy, yet that's the argument I keep seeing people make.

I'm not against fiber. I'm against arguments I don't understand and arguments that are stupid. I don't know whether the economic argument is the former or the latter, which is why I'm asking the question; so I can decide whether I don't understand or whether it's just a stupid argument.",,,

SQL *is* a programming language, and the entire point of a DB is to work in tandem with other programs, usually requiring some API/scripting management.  Being familiar with programming concepts and dblibs in Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP is a *huge* part of the difference between a good DB admin and a terrible one.

In SA, your best best for db work will be with the bigger companies.  Rackspace and USAA are sucking up all the tech talent they can find, but it's hard to get a Resume thru the filters.  I think HostGator is in a bit of a hiring freeze, but if you know any Linux, then they'll probably at least give you an interview.  The school districts usually have open IT positions, General Dynamics has some IT here in town, and Accenture has cold called me an annoying amount of times for some entry level stuff, but the pay they offer is an insult.

If you want to do db work, then start applying for every db position you can find.  Experience is the best and fastest teacher.",,,
"I'm switching to Google fiber from spectrum, unless you have a special plan, it is cheaper for more. Not as crazy download and upload speeds. I will have Sling, every major streaming service, and faster internet for cheap.

I will say that as far as getting your money's worth, fiber is the way to go. I want to have smart gadgets in my house, and spectrum just doesn't give enough to run them all at a reasonable price.",,,

"Binding arbitration is one of those ideas that sounded kind of OK in theory, but in practice has turned out to be horrible. It's \*\*ALWAYS\*\* biased in favor of the more powerful party, often blatantly so.

Anecdote: I used to do tech support for a law firm in a different city, and that law firm was contracted by a large employer who hired many immigrant workers to do physically dangerous jobs. I'm being vague here deliberately. All on the job injuries were sent to binding arbitration done by lawyers at the firm where I worked.

Once I happened to overhear a couple of the lawyers who did binding arbitration chuckling because they were talking about this idiot employee who thought there was any chance at all that they'd rule against the company.

So.... Yeah. Fuck binding arbitration sideways. It's just a way for the powerful party to abuse the less powerful party.",,,

"Their Bravo line of detergent may have been produced by Tide, but my post clearly references their new BRAVO PLUS line, made by Seatex, based in Rosenberg, Texas.

The entire Bravo Plus product is produced in Texas: the bottle is molded by N2it Containers in Houston and the fragrance is made by Houston-based Clarity Fragrances.

I found a press release here: http://www.seatexcorp.com/about/featured-news/bravo-plus

To quote from this release ""Two of the Lone Star State's finest institutions have joined forces to offer Texans the finest in quality products. Chemical blending company Seatex and regional supermarket chain, HEB have partnered to launch Bravo Plus, a cutting edge detergent and fabric softener brand that is sure to leave a customer satisfied! ""We partnered with HEB to develop a new product that independent testing has proven is one of the best in the market, yet offers consumers a savings over the leading national brand,"" says Seatex CEO Jim Nattier.""

The release further states ""according to Nattier, this partnership benefits all parties involved. ""HEB clearly strives to source products from Texas. They asked us to develop a supply chain with as many Texas based components as we possibly could. We were able to accomplish that beyond both our expectations. HEB's stores are in Texas, and we both wanted to create as many Texas jobs as possible in the manufacturing of these products.""
