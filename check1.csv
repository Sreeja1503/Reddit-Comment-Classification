1,"Since I cover video games on my site, [cheap plug](http://original-gamer.com/), I've met up with some local developers. Like others have said, there isn't much. It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go.

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies.

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store.

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!",1,1,1,"since i cover video games on my site cheap plug ive met up with some local developers like others have said there isnt much its all indie developers like two developers that i know that formed a company called d generation i also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company thats doing a mmo

First of all, I recommend /r/recruitinghell just so you don't feel all alone.  It's not super active, but sometimes it is nice to know other people are dealing with the same game.  \[Edit\] sub to /r/excel and learn everything you can

Second, get someone to practice interviewing with and have at least one person review your CV.  Talk to classmates (or anyone that you have worked with) and ask them to describe what was good about working with you.  Try to take those and create a blurb about what you bring to the table.

Third, linkedin is your friend.  Click the search box and then click all filters and narrow your search down.  After you find interesting companies/positions, search for people in accounting jobs there.  Ideally find something in common with someone and contact them.  If they are in hiring positions (controller/manager/cfo) say something like ""even though you aren't hiring entry level right now, I would like to have a 5 minute phone conversation to see if my skills might be of use to you in the future and also if I would be a good fit in the culture.""  Even really busy people are often willing to take 5 minutes to help someone out.  Also, be active.  Not like spam active, but like things that are relevant, comment where you have something intelligent say.  It moves you up the chain and increases your views.

Fourth, learn area codes in India and just swipe left on all those.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",0,0,0,"gt

59,"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

It is possible to find a studio apartment in SA for about $550/month.

So the total cost per piece of avocado toast is about 35 cents.

They call in and report ""kidnapping"", ""assault"", and other crimes and when the dispatchers asks for the information, they cuss them out and say it's Bexar county who is the one who should be arrested. What's dumb about this is 2 things: 1) he goes to the constables office or to the smaller municipalities like Leon Valley and blames the sheriff's office and 2) they tie up the phone lines and have actual emergency calls waiting in queue while they continue to harass the dispatchers, hang up, and re-dial. Apparently his following is rather large enough that when he does these things they get hundreds of anonymous calls and death threats within hours following his arrest. The dispatchers have pretty good patience to be able to handle these calls and fortunately no one has suffered yet from the influx of 911 call abuse.

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness. I've had two witnesses use earbuds so they could get answers. In one instance, we noticed a juror mute and turn off her camera. Turns out she went to work.

Jury selection is much faster in person and, in my experience as a seasoned trial attorney, more effective at producing a truly fair jury. My longest trial was 14 days, so 2 and a half work weeks. That involved trying offenses from the 1980s and late 2000s simultaneously. Horribly complicated case. By Zoom, it would've been a month or more.

Ask the recruiter what were your weaknesses.  Maybe there is something in your background check that you need to cleanup.

185,"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",1,0,0,"the city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council the city charter and state law how the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat sheryl sculley has shown that shes been able to do this quite well

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink.

&gt; 
&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8

I'll have to watch that at home. It's blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn't think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it's a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)
(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?


Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. 

There are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn't COVID related and shouldn't be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. 

Economics.  The ultimate ""facts don't care about your feelings"" subject.  :D 


Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I'm assuming you're American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it's a jobs program. 

""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we'll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". 

We have social security - it's in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I'll be lucky to never use.   I'd argue that it works, but could work better.   

If we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what's better for everyone. 

Now we just need to keep voting in better politicians who actually have OUR interests at heart, and toss them out the moment their lies and bullshit comes to light.",0,0,0,"gt one if the best explanations ive seen in regards to why the  minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation

ill have to watch that at home its blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content  didnt think youtube allowed that  my company is pretty conservative though so maybe its a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter
reading the cbo report on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting  it strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people  

tldr  a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community food home improvements electronics clothing vehicles etc   it basically stimulates the local economy  that stimulates the business owners they buy from and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on  its a trickleup effect 



gt the problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice dont function at all if you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas stop bombing foreign countries stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce

i agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste but i hope thats merely pandering  it seems like many progressive politicians are talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war the benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans the last four years have been rough on veterans and active duty alike   i guess what im trying to say is that the progressives i see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities domestic oil solar hydro and wind power was big even as far back as  under obama so reducing the foreign reliance is there and hopefully growing   these liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work 


trump signing the omnibus bill with the usaid gender studies package actually surprised me   i am a big fan of finding out why theres so much violence against women there and how it can be reduced  overly simplified i suspect religion and education reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders  at the same time i am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general 
we spend billions every year on israel and egypt and pakistan and several other countries  if we could cut that in half and billions to israel  an apartheid country that seems a little counter to our values we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home 

gt 
gt the only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit ie amazon google etc the same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech
gt 

well they lobbied against it hard until the bad press cost them more  then they found out in the case of amazon that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants so they actually do benefit from it  and then good press they get for tweeting things like we challenge our competitors to match us or one better pay  and throw the gauntlet back at us as i think bezos or some amazon dude tweeted  hell bofa pays  

ultimately i think were in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it so we dont accidentally give large corporations more money  thats punishing people to try to spite a large corporation  thats not good either 



gt it makes them money not the private citizen i always find it ironic the left is fighting fascism and the establishment when mainstream media social media big tech higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left how much establishment is left to fight against


uhh  you might want to read the book dark money by jane mayer  it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes  certainly not all but overwhelmingly 

the very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that theyre successful in keeping it hidden from common knowledge 

im a capitalist and a fan of the nordic model so i really dont have too much of a problem companies making good money as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide  that is what i want to ensure happens and thats why i pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way 

make people richer and their communities will thrive and if they thrive they spend more money and then the companies thrive and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle  its a little like the tax rates back in the s and s  a time when the us was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast 

gt 
gt you elevate the community by elevating the individual you dont elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that dont wealth redistribution covid relief packages where only  actually goes to covid relief does not work youre telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend socialism and communism never work

this is what ive been trying to say  the last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses while enriching the very few at the top  the very wealth distribution youre against see the trump tax cut as a prime example  yikes   we need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for 

i dont actually know how little of trumps relief was helpful or went where it should have but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic  or hopefully will 
the part about  seems a little shady  by the time you figure in over  billion in stimulus checks almost  billion for unemployment and federal supplement and  billion for safe school reopenings and  billion for vaccine production and distribution and ppe we get pretty far over the  number you quote 

there are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isnt covid related and shouldnt be in there but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage etc 

economics  the ultimate facts dont care about your feelings subject  d 


socialism and communism might have their downside  i dont think weve seen too much communist tendencies despite the last four years thats more despotism nepotism and cronyism  socialism is something that is huge in our country the us  im assuming youre american here  look at the military  stripped down to its core its a jobs program 

give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and well give you housing insurance food and clothing 

we have social security  its in the name   my taxes pay for schools sidewalks police and fire departments and infrastructure some of which ill be lucky to never use   id argue that it works but could work better   

if we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government aka draining the swamp it would probably work a whole lot better   i keep referring back to the last four years because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances instead of doing whats better for everyone 

now we just need to keep voting in better politicians who actually have our interests at heart and toss them out the moment their lies and bullshit comes to light",1407,4

It doesn't get that hot here (100ish, give or take) in the summer, but it's the *humidity* that kills me.  Walking outside feels like stepping into a sauna. You sweat and get sticky instantly.

Most of the options were adding a bunch of equipment I didn’t have or need and cost between 10,000 and 16,000 dollars.
They also offered financing of the repairs 10 years at 9% interest which is a total rip-off.

That's a lie. He matched an initial description and that's fair. Ometu is right to be upset because he doesn't know what's going and probably doesn't want any involvement.

If that is not an option then check out a school at Stinson municipal. That is a towered airport but it's own Class D which is at the south edge of the busy airspace so you can get out quickly.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0,0,"i will generally post these monday wednesday and friday evenings

310,"It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it's left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn't have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don't. 

Yes, it's more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren't the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don't know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren't enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.

The answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn't an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.

Texas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?

The state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)

343,"I was actually there when this happened. My girlfriend, daughter and two year old granddaughter went to San Antonio for spring break. The baby wasn’t feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I’m an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I’ve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell. It’s strange how your mind works when your senses are overwhelmed by adrenaline. I knew that we were far enough away that we were safe. I looked upwards to see if power lines were in the tree limbs and I jumped in front of the stroller to make sure the baby wouldn’t be injured by fleeing people. I also remember having the irrelevant thought that “it’s not even that windy”. When the tree actually impacted, it was chaos. I heard a woman screaming. What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word “baby”. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I’m not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn’t something I’m good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I’m so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children’s backpacks right next to it. I looked for a few more minutes and thankfully didn’t find anyone. As I navigated my way out, I administered another cursing over-you guessed it, power lines. This time to a guest who told me to stay away from them. If you’ve watched the video, I’m the guy with the  gray ponytail. It turned out, that the family who was injured, lives a few miles away from me. I don’t know them but the mother works in a school cafeteria. I mention this because that should make it obvious that she isn’t wealthy. If you can help, please do. There is a Go Fund Me page. I don’t want to invade the families privacy so you can find it on your own if you look. We left the zoo immediately afterwards. On the drive home I looked at the news. Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a “limb” had fallen. They also reported that the zoo’s EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn’t at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

382,"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not.

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things.

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student.

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice.

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time.

Because I don't understand why I should care about that. It may be free economically, but it would take political will to turn on, and that's political will that could be aimed at something more important than enabling some janitor at SAHA to stream seven pornos simultaneously while on the clock.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for. The ""digital divide"" isn't from people having access to cable speeds instead of fiber speeds. Some poor guy in the projects isn't failing to better himself because he doesn't have FIOS.

Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

Great community and good store and a chill place to play and hang. Check out their Facebook for events and stuff. If you're into things like 40k or Bolt Action or something there's lots of stores that do that too, PM me for more details.

For beers, check out some of the local bars that do fun community nights. Personally I'm a fan of the Bombay Bicycle Club's trivia night, Alamo Beer Company does some stuff that's fun. Lots of other solid smaller breweries too (Brew Monkey, Isela Street).

If you're looking for a fun physical thing with a good community, strong recommend to Armadillo Boulders, a really great climbing gym that's down by the Pearl.

As a younger man I did a lot of side work and consulting for different groups, but the pay was always at a lower rate than my corporate job. I've seen two replies now stating that a small scale operation should have equal compensation to the largest scale education systems. :( 

So if you were offered a position with a small church or home setting to teach only 4 children instead of 20+, you would need to make equal to a district position?  Or do you think more pay is required since you lose the TRS benefit? I understand the desire to not go backwards in your career, but the scope of work is significantly smaller, isn't it? Am I missing something major about the position I have not considered? 

One of my friends graduated a few years ago and finished her student classroom hours, but she is teaching at a church pre-school for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage. I guess I just had some wildly incorrect conclusions based off of the education friends I have on Facebook.

I think I'm going to give up while I'm ahead. I don't know what I'm going to do when school opens. I have already had two family members catch covid and it's no joke. :(

497,"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

Even though this city has a lot of people it's really a small town. It most definitely doesn't have a Paris or London vibe to it. I would compare it more to the country than the city in almost all ways except for the traffic. Glasgow might actually be a decent comparison to make but we're not as metropolitan or diverse as Berlin.

This isn't a media or tech hub by any means. What I mean is that there aren't really that many tech companies around here (we have a tough time hiring the amount of talent that we need) and there's not the same computer culture that there is in other cities. It's very much a blue collar country town.

But the cost of living is less here than in Austin or other towns which sets you up for more financial success as you're not going to be paying out as much in rent, gas, etc as you would somewhere else.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

547,"Absolutely. Agree with everything you said. There is no doubt that CPS will need this.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source.

561,"I don't see where I said drug abuse is a new problem.  I'm in my mid 40s I have seen the change in society's behavior and it's alarming . Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.",0,0,0,"i dont see where i said drug abuse is a new problem  im in my mid s i have seen the change in societys behavior and its alarming  not that mental illnesses homelessness and crime didnt exists before i was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and its getting worse every day

It's by no means my favorite, but the crime doesn't stand out any more than anywhere else, the rush hour traffic is generally better than other cities of equivalent size, the zoo is small but fun, seaworld has a park here, the children's museum is great, I've only seen one better (St. Louis).

750,"Robert Flores first fell in love with Fred’s Fish Fry back in high school when he used to hit the pokey little takeout joint that’s still afloat in a sea of auto parts scrapyards on Somerset Road.

Decades later, the 65-year-old still heeds the sweet siren call of Fred’s rectangular fish fillets, round shrimp pieces and their famous tartar sauce. Now, at least once a week, he and his wife hit the Fred’s at 6323 Old Pearsall Road, a downright palatial location in comparison to what will always be his seafood pride of the South Side.

“Check this out. So when I was in the military, I was gone for 14 years,” Flores said. “Where do you think the first place I went to when I came back? No lie, Fred’s Fish.”

The South and West Side institution is still dishing out the same fish and chips after more than 50 years and despite the persistent rumor that the chain is a drug front or some other criminal cover-up to explain its apparent lack of customers or cars in the parking lot. That rumor has circulated for decades and now is the basis for several memes on social media.

Why don’t you see cars in the lot? Most customers get takeout, and several locations don’t even have a dining room.

That takeout now is the stuff of San Antonio legend, a tradition carried out for generations one greasy, three-piece shrimp and fish platter-filled box at a time.

Take the Fred’s at 603 N. Zarzamora Street. In just one late afternoon hour, the West Side location saw multiple demographic groups dive in for an order of fried seafood with a heaping side of memories to-go.

Delia Gonzales, a 32-year-old mom with her 6-year-old son, proudly declared she swings by every other day and has loved the shrimp, onion rings and just about anything else at Fred’s since she was 17. Ditto Jose Gutierrez, 65, retired from the Army and the Marines who’s been a Fred’s fan through high school, Vietnam and two trips around the world.

Then there was Beatrice Perez, a 70-year-old grandmother with her 9-year-old grandson. She professed a similar love for Fred’s three-piece fish order, a love that goes back to her 20s.

“It’s a family tradition,” Gutierrez said. “ ‘Hey, let’s go to Fred’s.’ ”

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio’s Pig Stand diner has a heart that won’t quit

What started in 1963 with a single fish fry on the 4800 block of Roosevelt Avenue has quietly spawned to a school of 16 Alamo City locations, more than the number of area Long John Silver’s and Sea Island Shrimp House locations combined.

Most Fred’s takeout meals come in a basic 5- by 7-inch box with a Fred’s logo. The seafood platters — ranging from $10.05 for two fried pieces each of shrimp, oysters and white fish to $47.04 for a dozen pieces each of shrimp and fish — include tartar sauce, ketchup and bread. Prices aside, it’s been the same since pretty much the beginning.

The distinctive Fred’s sign — a gray fish leaping out of green water — has been the same since the early 1970s. And the menu still sports photos and prices of Fred’s signature fish and shrimp, still battered and breaded by the same company the Castellanos refuse to name but who they say refuses to work with anyone else.

Even the name behind the business remains relatively unchanged. The seafood legacy of late founding father Alfred Castellano Sr. and his son Alfred Castellano Jr. now carries on with Alfred Castellano III and his sister Teresa Castellano.

“I’ve got two helpers here. Well, two bosses now,” said Castellano Jr., 75. “I’m semi-retired.”

Seated in a conference room at the Fred’s main office and processing plant, just down the road from that location on Somerset, the Castellanos served up the kind of secrets to success that sound about as square as their fish fillets: Avoid the middleman, don’t get into debt and never fix what isn’t broken. The Castellanos have stuck by that simple and consistent recipe since Castellano Sr. died in 1971.

The Castellanos say they save money by buying seafood directly from fisheries and processing and distributing it themselves. They also buy and build on the property of every Fred’s location, which they own instead of lease.

And those locations, which already bear a small footprint, bear an equally small staff. The busier Fred’s restaurants may have up to four employees at a time, Castellano III said, while the tinier walk-ups have spells where they get along just fine with a single staffer.

“So when people question a lot, we’re just not splurging on stuff we don’t need,” said Castellano III, who added that such misconceptions about Fred’s are a big reason why the company doesn’t bother with social media.

“We sell a good product, and it’s all the same,” Castellano Jr. said. “All the stores you go to, it should be the same.”

On ExpressNews.com: These 6 classic San Antonio carousels take nostalgia and history by the reins

That continuity and ready nostalgia has earned more fans than drug-front speculators online. One such fan is Joel “Tatu” Herrera, the owner of Folklores Coffee House on South Flores Street, about 4 miles from Fred’s headquarters.

“(As a kid) I remember vividly on Fridays my dad would always get Fred’s Fish Fry,” Herrera said. “(For) our parents’ generation, that was the place for fried fish.”

A few years ago, he struck up a friendship with the Castellanos and toured their facility where they make the bulk of their menu items in-house. “Me being a chef, to me it’s amazing that they’ve kept up this legacy going for such a long time,” he said.

He was so impressed, he took to Facebook to promote the brand, making it the No. 7 reason to love the South Side, a clap back at the persistent drug-front stigma.

The Castellanos have heard it before, and shake their heads with a weary laugh.

“Let me tell you something,” Castellano Jr. said. “We don’t do stuff like that.”

Castellano Jr., who was a former chairman of San Antonio’s Firefighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Service Commission, said such rumors about Fred’s don’t bother him because a) only “people who are stupid” make up such stories and b) he can assure that “the police and everybody else has looked at it and checked us out, (and) we have no problems.”

The law sure seems to back him up. The San Antonio Police Department replied to an Express-News inquiry into such rumors by noting its narcotics division has no record of issues at any Fred’s Fish Fry locations.

“I think the big charm to Fred’s is when you grew up on the West Side and the South Side, that’s what you could afford,” Herrera said. “When you go to Fred’s you feel like you’re back home, all those memories and that good stuff. That’s the great thing about food, and that’s the great thing about having something consistent like them.”

That whimsical love for Fred’s also goes for its employees. Christina Stricker was 5 when she had her first Fred’s fish from the Somerset location. Now 47, she rings up such memories at many a Fred’s register, including the one on North Zarzamora.

“The fish has not changed,” Stricker said, then added with a laugh. “The atmosphere hasn’t changed.”

What will change for Fred’s is how customers can express their appreciation for the chain beyond just picking up another three-piece fish to-go.

For the first time, Fred’s will sell branded T-shirts. Those should be out in the next couple of months, just in time for Fred’s third Fiesta medal release. Fred’s also is looking into food delivery services such as Grubhub for those who’d rather reel in their orders from home or work. And they’ll have a new website soon with more food photos and information.

In the meantime, Fred’s Fish Fry looks to just keep on keeping on with the same no-frills formula that’s made it the biggest little seafood chain in San Antonio, despite one whopper of a fish tale about how they do it.

Speaking of music, there are a lot of people who come out for our musical guests. Entrance to Teddyloid's set and the ALL OFF concert are both included with the badge you purchase. Give 'em a listen, if you're into that.

Not only do we have free play areas where you can enjoy things with friends (or make new ones), we've got scheduled tournaments as well. And we even have this neat retro game museum that people are free to peruse and even play a few consoles in.

Plus, I know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetups/panels (which again, aren't just restricted to anime fandoms). If you're really curious, I'd suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule (http://san-japan.org/events/schedule) to see if there are things there you might be interested in.

plus i know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetupspanels which again arent just restricted to anime fandoms if youre really curious id suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule  to see if there are things there you might be interested in note that doesnt contain our gaming schedules or the stuff thats open regularly like karaoke or the retro game museum

i know literally the most basic of basics about anime like dragon ball z and sailor moon are about as far as i ever really got but i have a sincerely awesome experience at sj every time which is part of the reason why ive been helping to run it for the past few years i could literally go on and on about all the content we have at san japan thats my job at the con i managecoordinate most of the programming that goes on but these are some of the highlights hope this helped to answer your question even if it was a little bit lengthy",398,1

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

885,"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  

There are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.

if users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile you cant ride  the app suggests using a ride share option  

and honestly destination should be required the app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to reenter them if youre a regular user but if its under half a mile it should point out it would be better to walk i would say you should have to enter your height amp weight on the app as well and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination the scooter detects weight of the rider too so if someone is short and overweight by national health standards and trying to go a very short distance the app points out suggesting to walk  

there are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have  skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to  ton vehicles  

i rode in traffic at ish afternoon couple days ago on alamo heading south  i wasnt entirely scared as drivers seem to know to give fair way and buffer space but it was a little scary on that little thing  ",443,6

940,"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",0,0,0,"hi as i mentioned earlier the evidence is clear that covid is a threat to the country it is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle there are no studies or recommendations from prominentreputable us scientists or communities backing this up if covid laws and orders continue to popup without a clear scientific basis then that will ultimately undermine all measures this order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors there is no legislation that has been proposed this is just a dictated order all the lawmakers besides the mayorjudge that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper

There's no hiking, per se. It's more of a huge drunken party.  All the local parks, but mainly Breckenridge lately, become a mass of extended families pitching tents and CAMPING in the city park for the duration of the holiday, trashing the place and not picking up after themselves, which takes the city workers 2 days of cleanup.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other. 

That's the reason the parks are closed, because people can't behave and follow social distancing guidelines.  

The parks will be open again after the holiday weekend.

995,"I would recommend check out your community college if you want some hands-on experience. I would focus on network and security Plus it has all the info you need for tech hardware in there.

YouTube professor menser CompTIA Network plus and security Plus. If you're up for a really good challenge Cisco CCNA. And some routing and switching pair that with the security Plus you should be able to find a job 54k.
Public libraries will be your best friend to for good free resources and YouTube. Reddit is also another great source.

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form.

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well.
Check out usajobs.gov you might find a job there that you might want to try. Like the federal courts they're in San Antonio maybe they have an opening for a probation assistant it sounds like you would be qualify for or judicial assistant . Starting pay for both those jobs at least 42k and then the government has really good benefits.0
