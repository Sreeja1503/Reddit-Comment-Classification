2,"I know, its just harder than I thought living with my parents driving me up a wall.  When I was working; I was fine because I would literally be working 10-12 hours a day, get home, make something to eat, watch some Netflix or play video games, go to sleep, and repeat.  Not a whole lot of interactions except to organize a family movie night at a theater with my brother as well and not having it be so late for us to still go to bed and wake up the next morning at 5 or so...

Now I'm taking some online classes in computer science and business so I can hopefully learn and be able land something to be able to still work from home and making a pay check next time something like this happens.  I work for a wholesale business that delivers liquor to bars and restaurants - but when they shut down, business went down as well and we were out of a job for a week.  Luckily, our boss was also opening up 2 new stores before all this and is giving us some work to do to both help them out as well as us whenever this clears out and we can hit the ground running better prepared.  They're still going to pay us our full amount that we were getting before, just a different kind of work.  Still work.",,,,1197,0,1,1,1
13,"Keep in mind it’s way cheaper for your A/C company to tell you there isn’t a problem and it’s just something you have to deal with than it is to send someone out and possibly find a real issue that they have to correct under warranty.

I ran into this same situation with my first new-construction home.  I I had a room that was always warmer than all the others — called the A/C company to check it out (within the first year) and they showed up with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to get different readings to tell me it was within spec.  They also threw in other nonsensical reasons like getting more sun than other rooms (even though it shared a wall with two other bedrooms that didn’t have cooling issues).  Basically they gave me a big list of reasons why they shouldn’t have to do any actual work.  Note that at no point did they even look at the unit or duct work in the attic.

  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  

It would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking “it meets specs” and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didn’t stop to consider anything else.",,,,1533,0,0,0,1

YouTube professor menser CompTIA Network plus and security Plus. If you're up for a really good challenge Cisco CCNA. And some routing and switching pair that with the security Plus you should be able to find a job 54k.
Public libraries will be your best friend to for good free resources and YouTube. Reddit is also another great source.

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form. 

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well. 
Check out usajobs.gov you might find a job there that you might want to try. Like the federal courts they're in San Antonio maybe they have an opening for a probation assistant it sounds like you would be qualify for or judicial assistant .

The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into. Companies are going to want sample code / programs for devs, they'll want certifications for anything from project managers, to sysadmins, to account managers. 

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",,,,5741,0,1,1,1

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness. I've had two witnesses use earbuds so they could get answers. In one instance, we noticed a juror mute and turn off her camera. Turns out she went to work. You see all those Reddit threads complaining about ISPs? Man, connectivity issues can create chaos. As a future court reporter, you will prefer everyone be present in person, lol.

Jury selection is much faster in person and, in my experience as a seasoned trial attorney, more effective at producing a truly fair jury. My longest trial was 14 days, so 2 and a half work weeks. That involved trying offenses from the 1980s and late 2000s simultaneously. Horribly complicated case. By Zoom, it would've been a month or more. In person, we regularly finish murders in 4 or 5 days.

What I know from what I've seen in this thread.

You attended college.  You have typing skills and phone skills.  You want to avoid food (can't blame you, that's my wife's default and it sucks.)

Put together a solid CV.  And by that I mean research and learn how to sale yourself.  You are the product.  Send it to family and friends and former co-workers/bosses to get feedback.  It is very easy to short sell yourself.  

I saw on reddit that someone got a media job by doxing themselves as a karma whore and knowing how and when to use social media.  A few weeks ago I saw a post on linkedin that they were interviewing someone that listed google as a skill.

Think of everything, and give yourself credit.  Do you just want a better paying job or do you want to work on building a career?  How can you leverage your education and experience.  Reach out on linked in to people in positions that you wish you had.  ATS sucks so networking is everything.  If you had interviews and were denied, try and figure out why.  Ask the recruiter what were your weaknesses.  Maybe there is something in your background check that you need to cleanup.

Finding a better job is now your second job.  Feel free to PM if you want.  I ended up hiring a career coach after my last layoff because people thought I was too old to do what I do.

&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement – I swap “Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoint” for “Proficient in Breathing Oxygen” and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes I’ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to “sink” your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with “Fluency in English,” I assume you are “fluent” in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So don’t re-assure me.

502,"I currently have CPS Home Manager and have had it for about a year.  I really like it and it has saved us money because I never had a programmable thermostat before.  Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

594,"""H-E-B said it has expanded its multi-year deal with marketing technology and in-store customer experience provider Stratacache — an ongoing deal that provides the food retailer with greater digital insights into its customers.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, can be custom-tailored to the grocery vertical offers retailers the ability to deeply personalize online shopping experiences instead of compelling shoppers to wade through tens of thousands of possible choices. ThryveAI, a Mi9 Retail retail brand, launched last month and already touts supermarket clients such as Meijer, Wakefern Food Corp., ShopRite, Mariano's, Giant Eagle and more. Now, ThryveAI has partnered with taste intelligence company Halla to integrate grocery-specific AI into the ThryveAI digital commerce platform""

597,"Absolutely. Agree with everything you said. There is no doubt that CPS will need this.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. 

&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)

800,"Robert Flores first fell in love with Fred’s Fish Fry back in high school when he used to hit the pokey little takeout joint that’s still afloat in a sea of auto parts scrapyards on Somerset Road.

Decades later, the 65-year-old still heeds the sweet siren call of Fred’s rectangular fish fillets, round shrimp pieces and their famous tartar sauce. Now, at least once a week, he and his wife hit the Fred’s at 6323 Old Pearsall Road, a downright palatial location in comparison to what will always be his seafood pride of the South Side.

“Check this out. So when I was in the military, I was gone for 14 years,” Flores said. “Where do you think the first place I went to when I came back? No lie, Fred’s Fish.”

The South and West Side institution is still dishing out the same fish and chips after more than 50 years and despite the persistent rumor that the chain is a drug front or some other criminal cover-up to explain its apparent lack of customers or cars in the parking lot. That rumor has circulated for decades and now is the basis for several memes on social media.

Why don’t you see cars in the lot? Most customers get takeout, and several locations don’t even have a dining room.

That takeout now is the stuff of San Antonio legend, a tradition carried out for generations one greasy, three-piece shrimp and fish platter-filled box at a time.

Take the Fred’s at 603 N. Zarzamora Street. In just one late afternoon hour, the West Side location saw multiple demographic groups dive in for an order of fried seafood with a heaping side of memories to-go.

Delia Gonzales, a 32-year-old mom with her 6-year-old son, proudly declared she swings by every other day and has loved the shrimp, onion rings and just about anything else at Fred’s since she was 17. Ditto Jose Gutierrez, 65, retired from the Army and the Marines who’s been a Fred’s fan through high school, Vietnam and two trips around the world.

Then there was Beatrice Perez, a 70-year-old grandmother with her 9-year-old grandson. She professed a similar love for Fred’s three-piece fish order, a love that goes back to her 20s.

“It’s a family tradition,” Gutierrez said. “ ‘Hey, let’s go to Fred’s.’ ”

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio’s Pig Stand diner has a heart that won’t quit

What started in 1963 with a single fish fry on the 4800 block of Roosevelt Avenue has quietly spawned to a school of 16 Alamo City locations, more than the number of area Long John Silver’s and Sea Island Shrimp House locations combined.

Most Fred’s takeout meals come in a basic 5- by 7-inch box with a Fred’s logo. The seafood platters — ranging from $10.05 for two fried pieces each of shrimp, oysters and white fish to $47.04 for a dozen pieces each of shrimp and fish — include tartar sauce, ketchup and bread. Prices aside, it’s been the same since pretty much the beginning.

The distinctive Fred’s sign — a gray fish leaping out of green water — has been the same since the early 1970s. And the menu still sports photos and prices of Fred’s signature fish and shrimp, still battered and breaded by the same company the Castellanos refuse to name but who they say refuses to work with anyone else.

Even the name behind the business remains relatively unchanged. The seafood legacy of late founding father Alfred Castellano Sr. and his son Alfred Castellano Jr. now carries on with Alfred Castellano III and his sister Teresa Castellano.

“I’ve got two helpers here. Well, two bosses now,” said Castellano Jr., 75. “I’m semi-retired.”

Seated in a conference room at the Fred’s main office and processing plant, just down the road from that location on Somerset, the Castellanos served up the kind of secrets to success that sound about as square as their fish fillets: Avoid the middleman, don’t get into debt and never fix what isn’t broken. The Castellanos have stuck by that simple and consistent recipe since Castellano Sr. died in 1971.

The Castellanos say they save money by buying seafood directly from fisheries and processing and distributing it themselves. They also buy and build on the property of every Fred’s location, which they own instead of lease.

And those locations, which already bear a small footprint, bear an equally small staff. The busier Fred’s restaurants may have up to four employees at a time, Castellano III said, while the tinier walk-ups have spells where they get along just fine with a single staffer.

“So when people question a lot, we’re just not splurging on stuff we don’t need,” said Castellano III, who added that such misconceptions about Fred’s are a big reason why the company doesn’t bother with social media.

“We sell a good product, and it’s all the same,” Castellano Jr. said. “All the stores you go to, it should be the same.”

On ExpressNews.com: These 6 classic San Antonio carousels take nostalgia and history by the reins

That continuity and ready nostalgia has earned more fans than drug-front speculators online. One such fan is Joel “Tatu” Herrera, the owner of Folklores Coffee House on South Flores Street, about 4 miles from Fred’s headquarters.

“(As a kid) I remember vividly on Fridays my dad would always get Fred’s Fish Fry,” Herrera said. “(For) our parents’ generation, that was the place for fried fish.”

A few years ago, he struck up a friendship with the Castellanos and toured their facility where they make the bulk of their menu items in-house. “Me being a chef, to me it’s amazing that they’ve kept up this legacy going for such a long time,” he said.

He was so impressed, he took to Facebook to promote the brand, making it the No. 7 reason to love the South Side, a clap back at the persistent drug-front stigma.

The Castellanos have heard it before, and shake their heads with a weary laugh.

“Let me tell you something,” Castellano Jr. said. “We don’t do stuff like that.”

Castellano Jr., who was a former chairman of San Antonio’s Firefighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Service Commission, said such rumors about Fred’s don’t bother him because a) only “people who are stupid” make up such stories and b) he can assure that “the police and everybody else has looked at it and checked us out, (and) we have no problems.”

The law sure seems to back him up. The San Antonio Police Department replied to an Express-News inquiry into such rumors by noting its narcotics division has no record of issues at any Fred’s Fish Fry locations.

“I think the big charm to Fred’s is when you grew up on the West Side and the South Side, that’s what you could afford,” Herrera said. “When you go to Fred’s you feel like you’re back home, all those memories and that good stuff. That’s the great thing about food, and that’s the great thing about having something consistent like them.”

That whimsical love for Fred’s also goes for its employees. Christina Stricker was 5 when she had her first Fred’s fish from the Somerset location. Now 47, she rings up such memories at many a Fred’s register, including the one on North Zarzamora.

“The fish has not changed,” Stricker said, then added with a laugh. “The atmosphere hasn’t changed.”

What will change for Fred’s is how customers can express their appreciation for the chain beyond just picking up another three-piece fish to-go.

For the first time, Fred’s will sell branded T-shirts. Those should be out in the next couple of months, just in time for Fred’s third Fiesta medal release. Fred’s also is looking into food delivery services such as Grubhub for those who’d rather reel in their orders from home or work. And they’ll have a new website soon with more food photos and information.

In the meantime, Fred’s Fish Fry looks to just keep on keeping on with the same no-frills formula that’s made it the biggest little seafood chain in San Antonio, despite one whopper of a fish tale about how they do it.

990,"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",,,,3596,0,1,1,1

I've never sold there, only bought - but I've witnessed many a transaction and have known the family since 2000. If you come in person, they are kind enough to tell you what your items are worth in the current market and why. They have always been about repeat business and building relationships. They respect your time.

Just be careful you don't spend the money you get for your gold/diamonds then and there. The place is stocked with treasures - art that has appraised value; antique furniture, carpets, lamps, glass, vases, depression glass, crystal in all sizes and shapes, chandeliers; Icons; old stained glass windows and tiffany lamps; signed native american turquoise with some pieces over a hundred years old, etc... They are willing to work with you on payment and prices. Their word and handshake mean something.

They also employ a smith who can work on any kind of stone or metal - so repairs, modification, or fabrication are all possible.  Perhaps change your ring into something new and cool? All for a fair price and in a timely fashion.

Ask for Quinn. His masters is in Art History and he used to teach at UTSA before taking on the business full time with his mother after his father passed a few years ago. 

Check out their facebook, but don't be intimidated by how nice the photos and items are. Hint: Bargain hard. Everyone from bartenders to taxi drivers to chefs to judges to politicians to pro athletes shop, hang out and sell there.

1158,"Since I cover video games on my site, [cheap plug](http://original-gamer.com/), I've met up with some local developers. Like others have said, there isn't much. It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go. 

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies. 

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store. 

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!

First of all, I recommend /r/recruitinghell just so you don't feel all alone.  It's not super active, but sometimes it is nice to know other people are dealing with the same game.  \[Edit\] sub to /r/excel and learn everything you can

Second, get someone to practice interviewing with and have at least one person review your CV.  Talk to classmates (or anyone that you have worked with) and ask them to describe what was good about working with you.  Try to take those and create a blurb about what you bring to the table.

Third, linkedin is your friend.  Click the search box and then click all filters and narrow your search down.  After you find interesting companies/positions, search for people in accounting jobs there.  Ideally find something in common with someone and contact them.  If they are in hiring positions (controller/manager/cfo) say something like ""even though you aren't hiring entry level right now, I would like to have a 5 minute phone conversation to see if my skills might be of use to you in the future and also if I would be a good fit in the culture.""  Even really busy people are often willing to take 5 minutes to help someone out.  Also, be active.  Not like spam active, but like things that are relevant, comment where you have something intelligent say.  It moves you up the chain and increases your views.

Fourth, learn area codes in India and just swipe left on all those.

Fifth, read all the self help articles you have time for.

By Richard Webner, Staff WriterAugust 4, 2016 Updated: August 4, 2016 11:04pm

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio’s City Council approved a request Thursday from the property’s current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

“It’s a brand with global cache, and it’s one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,” said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg’s office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla’s presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company’s electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer’s recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn’t respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

“It’s a corridor that’s accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,” Nirenberg said. It is “one of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.”

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of “Tesla in Texas,” which touts the company’s position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe’s cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

I'm not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would've hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn't care what the cost of production is, it's only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.

I love nuclear plants, they're an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \* 72 hrs \* $9,000/MWh = \~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.",,,,1224,1,1,1,1

There was a problem, though. Duncan never agreed to be photographed holding the sign or to endorse Elder, an agent at Keller Williams in San Antonio.

Duncan now is suing Elder, Keller Williams and some other parties alleging misappropriation of the retired basketball player’s name and image. The suit, filed in Bexar County District Court on Friday, seeks unspecified financial and punitive damages.

“It was just so blatant and so shameless,” said Michael D. Bernard, a lawyer for Duncan and former San Antonio city attorney. “We don’t want people to think this is OK or that it goes unnoticed, because it doesn’t. There is a consequence to it.”

If you’re handy with coding, or willing to shell out a few dollars (5er comes to mind) - you might be able to do a Facebook scrub looking for people with her name, in the age range you’re posturing. It’d probably also be worthwhile to check linkedin also - she may have listed it as experience or similar if she remained in that industry or area of work as an adult.",,,,471,0,0,0,1

1993,"&gt;Hey, if it's already in place and there will not be any additional costs, use it. Why do you ask the question?

Because I don't understand why I should care about that. It may be free economically, but it would take political will to turn on, and that's political will that could be aimed at something more important than enabling some janitor at SAHA to stream seven pornos simultaneously while on the clock.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for. The ""digital divide"" isn't from people having access to cable speeds instead of fiber speeds. Some poor guy in the projects isn't failing to better himself because he doesn't have FIOS.

Let's be honest with ourselves: unless we're some big data engineer/scientist, we want faster Internet for ultraHD Game of Thrones streams and so we can pirate an episode of the Daily Show in two seconds off Usenet.

&gt;Do you think it should be metered

no

&gt;Do you work for Time Warner, Comcast? 

Go fuck yourself for even suggesting something so vile.

**Edit** OK I guess I admit it would be cool to be able to stream something from my home network to my in-laws' house in Houston the couple times a year I go visit or to upload my videos from Cornyation a few times faster than I currently do. But LOL at lack of access to gigabit Internet being some sort of economic hindrance.

I could get behind an argument saying poors only have access to dialup and we need to get them some kind of bandwidth, absolutely—that really is a digital divide. You can't do MOOCs, e.g., with dialup. But an upgrade from cable to fiber isn't going to give you a leg up in the economy, yet that's the argument I keep seeing people make.

I'm not against fiber. I'm against arguments I don't understand and arguments that are stupid. I don't know whether the economic argument is the former or the latter, which is why I'm asking the question; so I can decide whether I don't understand or whether it's just a stupid argument.",,,,2138,0,1,1,1
