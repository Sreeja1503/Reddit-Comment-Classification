The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into.

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students. Grads are much cheaper than an experienced hire, and the companies believe they can teach you everything you'll need to know from a technology standpoint.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",,,,5741,0,1,1

89,"&gt; what's worse is his followers tie up the 911 lines at bexar county. They call in and report ""kidnapping"", ""assault"", and other crimes and when the dispatchers asks for the information, they cuss them out and say it's Bexar county who is the one who should be arrested. What's dumb about this is 2 things: 1) he goes to the constables office or to the smaller municipalities like Leon Valley and blames the sheriff's office and 2) they tie up the phone lines and have actual emergency calls waiting in queue while they continue to harass the dispatchers, hang up, and re-dial. Apparently his following is rather large enough that when he does these things they get hundreds of anonymous calls and death threats within hours following his arrest. The dispatchers have pretty good patience to be able to handle these calls and fortunately no one has suffered yet from the influx of 911 call abuse.

185,"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",,,,3207,0,1,1

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up.

234,"I moved here from Denver.

It doesn't get that hot here (100ish, give or take) in the summer, but it's the *humidity* that kills me.  Walking outside feels like stepping into a sauna. You sweat and get sticky instantly. 
With the poor air quality (dust/pollen/stuff) I feel like Pig Pen.  You end up walking from air conditioned house, to air conditioned car, to air conditioned office etc.

You may be used to this in Ohio, so the winters here would be your happy place. It's less muggy and we rarely get below freezing for long. Snow is extremely rare and even ice days (roads closed when it rains while being below freezing) are very rare. 

The weather related issue that stands out is tires. Because of the generally dry climate, people use cheap, shitty and used tires. Tires on cars here are often bald (yeah, so I generally pay attention in parking lots) so a sprinkle of rain and it's vehicular bowling.

Ice days are to keep you home so other drivers don't careen into you. 

One major thing to consider is if you're prone to allergies. This place will make you suffer.

Actually, one major thing to consider is why you want to move here vs. any other place?

I’ve wondered the same thing ever since my first and last call to John Wayne.
I had a terrible experience with John Wayne.
I had a leak in a 5 year old condenser unit.
They told me it was not repairable, maybe, maybe not.

At one point the technician asked me “what my expectations were”. I said my expectations were , find the issue, fix the issue, simple.
Then they did an “assessment”, and gave me 5 or 6 “options”.
Most of the options were adding a bunch of equipment I didn’t have or need and cost between 10,000 and 16,000 dollars.
They also offered financing of the repairs 10 years at 9% interest which is a total rip-off.

Mind you, this was a 5 year old, 2200 sq ft home.
The final option that the guy no shit called a “band-aid” was to replace the leaking condenser coil.
They didn’t have the parts in stock and had to come back with another tech to complete.

We asked for the menus and he said it was clearly stated there were only two and walked away. Never saw the menus. Had to google their lunch time restaurant weeks menu and show him… which then prompted him to bring us that wine. Mind you- still got charged.

Are you immaculately cleaning the restaurant (including restrooms) every day, between meals and as required?

For x million iPhones in circulation; this will add up for Apple.  The new maps are not detailed in some spots as Google ones.

However; through sheer coincidence I installed the full Garmin app to my phone with turn by turn; which has walking, driving and public transit directions; the latter which the new maps lack.   This will affect me less; so I guess I am sort of wait and see on the OS6 but leaning toward upgrading when the download appears; for now.

Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?

750,"Robert Flores first fell in love with Fred’s Fish Fry back in high school when he used to hit the pokey little takeout joint that’s still afloat in a sea of auto parts scrapyards on Somerset Road.

Decades later, the 65-year-old still heeds the sweet siren call of Fred’s rectangular fish fillets, round shrimp pieces and their famous tartar sauce. Now, at least once a week, he and his wife hit the Fred’s at 6323 Old Pearsall Road, a downright palatial location in comparison to what will always be his seafood pride of the South Side.

“Check this out. So when I was in the military, I was gone for 14 years,” Flores said. “Where do you think the first place I went to when I came back? No lie, Fred’s Fish.”

The South and West Side institution is still dishing out the same fish and chips after more than 50 years and despite the persistent rumor that the chain is a drug front or some other criminal cover-up to explain its apparent lack of customers or cars in the parking lot. That rumor has circulated for decades and now is the basis for several memes on social media.

Why don’t you see cars in the lot? Most customers get takeout, and several locations don’t even have a dining room.

That takeout now is the stuff of San Antonio legend, a tradition carried out for generations one greasy, three-piece shrimp and fish platter-filled box at a time.

Take the Fred’s at 603 N. Zarzamora Street. In just one late afternoon hour, the West Side location saw multiple demographic groups dive in for an order of fried seafood with a heaping side of memories to-go.

Delia Gonzales, a 32-year-old mom with her 6-year-old son, proudly declared she swings by every other day and has loved the shrimp, onion rings and just about anything else at Fred’s since she was 17. Ditto Jose Gutierrez, 65, retired from the Army and the Marines who’s been a Fred’s fan through high school, Vietnam and two trips around the world.

Then there was Beatrice Perez, a 70-year-old grandmother with her 9-year-old grandson. She professed a similar love for Fred’s three-piece fish order, a love that goes back to her 20s.

“It’s a family tradition,” Gutierrez said. “ ‘Hey, let’s go to Fred’s.’ ”

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio’s Pig Stand diner has a heart that won’t quit

What started in 1963 with a single fish fry on the 4800 block of Roosevelt Avenue has quietly spawned to a school of 16 Alamo City locations, more than the number of area Long John Silver’s and Sea Island Shrimp House locations combined.

Most Fred’s takeout meals come in a basic 5- by 7-inch box with a Fred’s logo. The seafood platters — ranging from $10.05 for two fried pieces each of shrimp, oysters and white fish to $47.04 for a dozen pieces each of shrimp and fish — include tartar sauce, ketchup and bread. Prices aside, it’s been the same since pretty much the beginning.

The distinctive Fred’s sign — a gray fish leaping out of green water — has been the same since the early 1970s. And the menu still sports photos and prices of Fred’s signature fish and shrimp, still battered and breaded by the same company the Castellanos refuse to name but who they say refuses to work with anyone else.

Even the name behind the business remains relatively unchanged. The seafood legacy of late founding father Alfred Castellano Sr. and his son Alfred Castellano Jr. now carries on with Alfred Castellano III and his sister Teresa Castellano.

“I’ve got two helpers here. Well, two bosses now,” said Castellano Jr., 75. “I’m semi-retired.”

Seated in a conference room at the Fred’s main office and processing plant, just down the road from that location on Somerset, the Castellanos served up the kind of secrets to success that sound about as square as their fish fillets: Avoid the middleman, don’t get into debt and never fix what isn’t broken. The Castellanos have stuck by that simple and consistent recipe since Castellano Sr. died in 1971.

The Castellanos say they save money by buying seafood directly from fisheries and processing and distributing it themselves. They also buy and build on the property of every Fred’s location, which they own instead of lease.

And those locations, which already bear a small footprint, bear an equally small staff. The busier Fred’s restaurants may have up to four employees at a time, Castellano III said, while the tinier walk-ups have spells where they get along just fine with a single staffer.

“So when people question a lot, we’re just not splurging on stuff we don’t need,” said Castellano III, who added that such misconceptions about Fred’s are a big reason why the company doesn’t bother with social media.

“We sell a good product, and it’s all the same,” Castellano Jr. said. “All the stores you go to, it should be the same.”

On ExpressNews.com: These 6 classic San Antonio carousels take nostalgia and history by the reins

That continuity and ready nostalgia has earned more fans than drug-front speculators online. One such fan is Joel “Tatu” Herrera, the owner of Folklores Coffee House on South Flores Street, about 4 miles from Fred’s headquarters.

“(As a kid) I remember vividly on Fridays my dad would always get Fred’s Fish Fry,” Herrera said. “(For) our parents’ generation, that was the place for fried fish.”

A few years ago, he struck up a friendship with the Castellanos and toured their facility where they make the bulk of their menu items in-house. “Me being a chef, to me it’s amazing that they’ve kept up this legacy going for such a long time,” he said.

He was so impressed, he took to Facebook to promote the brand, making it the No. 7 reason to love the South Side, a clap back at the persistent drug-front stigma.

The Castellanos have heard it before, and shake their heads with a weary laugh.

“Let me tell you something,” Castellano Jr. said. “We don’t do stuff like that.”

Castellano Jr., who was a former chairman of San Antonio’s Firefighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Service Commission, said such rumors about Fred’s don’t bother him because a) only “people who are stupid” make up such stories and b) he can assure that “the police and everybody else has looked at it and checked us out, (and) we have no problems.”

The law sure seems to back him up. The San Antonio Police Department replied to an Express-News inquiry into such rumors by noting its narcotics division has no record of issues at any Fred’s Fish Fry locations.

“I think the big charm to Fred’s is when you grew up on the West Side and the South Side, that’s what you could afford,” Herrera said. “When you go to Fred’s you feel like you’re back home, all those memories and that good stuff. That’s the great thing about food, and that’s the great thing about having something consistent like them.”

That whimsical love for Fred’s also goes for its employees. Christina Stricker was 5 when she had her first Fred’s fish from the Somerset location. Now 47, she rings up such memories at many a Fred’s register, including the one on North Zarzamora.

“The fish has not changed,” Stricker said, then added with a laugh. “The atmosphere hasn’t changed.”

What will change for Fred’s is how customers can express their appreciation for the chain beyond just picking up another three-piece fish to-go.

For the first time, Fred’s will sell branded T-shirts. Those should be out in the next couple of months, just in time for Fred’s third Fiesta medal release.

In the meantime, Fred’s Fish Fry looks to just keep on keeping on with the same no-frills formula that’s made it the biggest little seafood chain in San Antonio, despite one whopper of a fish tale about how they do it.

Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

885,"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.

940,"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",,,,3596,0,1,1

It'll likely be similar to another wireless service I had read about, though I cant recall the name of the service:  
  
Large directional antenna on a neighborhood hub-home, hub home has directional antenna's to other individual homes. With the right wireless tech, I could see this being quite fast.  
  
Considering I can get ~30ms ping and ~100+mbps on LTE, I think a more powerful, directional, wireless tech could carry much more bandwidth and with great stability.  
  
LTE signal is broadcast in all directions, with a single transceiver connecting to hundreds if not thousands of phones (Which are small and battery-powered) and yet capable of getting great results. Even when I am moving at 65mph on the highway. Now... Increase the size of the client antenna, increase the broadcast power, make it directional, and stationary.  
  
That should just about take care of your concerns about latency, jitter, and slow speeds. With the hub/relay helping with issues of deadzones. The last concern is frequency congestion (something I know a bit about, trying to have my own wifi in an apartment complex)... I dont know what frequencies they have access to, if they own any spectrum, or what's legal to use in what way, but if Google says they can do it, I can take that small leap of faith.

1065,"More concerts have been canceled as tensions escalate between musicians and management of the San Antonio Symphony.

“Russian Masters” on Nov. 19-20, “Beethoven’s ‘Emperor’ Concerto” on Nov. 26-27, and “Holidays at The Majestic” on Dec. 18 have all been canceled by the Symphony Society of San Antonio, the board that oversees the orchestra’s operations.

According to Symphony spokesperson Kimberly Maldonado, “San Antonio Symphony Box Office representatives will contact all ticket holders directly over the phone in the coming days to ensure they understand next steps and all ticketing options.”

Following the Sept. 27 declaration of a strike by the Musicians of the San Antonio Symphony, the season-opening concerts of Oct. 28-29 and Nov. 5-6 were also canceled, with musicians periodically leafleting and picketing outside their main performance venue, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.

The dispute deepens
---

The latest development in the ongoing dispute is a charge by the Symphony Society filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Oct. 29, alleging bad-faith bargaining by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 23, which represents the musicians in contract negotiations for the national union.

The Symphony Society’s charge follows an earlier NLRB charge filed by AFM Local 23 on Oct. 25, alleging that the Symphony Society has engaged in unfair labor practices and bad-faith bargaining. When management informed the union it was canceling musicians’ health and other benefits on Oct. 28, the union added “Repudiation/Modification of Contract” to its earlier charge.

John Ferguson, the attorney representing orchestra management, said the Symphony Society’s charge is not a counter-charge but is wholly independent of the union’s earlier charge.

“Even if the union hadn’t filed their charge, I think the symphony probably would have filed their own,” Ferguson said.

A major part of the charge alleges that the union did “not [live] up to the letter and spirit of the parties’ agreement to first attempt to use interest based bargaining,” and refused to accept mediation by Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service commissioners.

Interest-based bargaining (IBB), also known as mutual gains bargaining, is a negotiation strategy meant to avoid adversarial bargaining, opting instead for “consensus-seeking and cooperative” negotiations.

David Van Os, attorney for the musicians, said mediators present for the earlier IBB negotiation sessions showed bias toward management, in part because the musicians were not allowed to focus on the 80% pay cuts they had endured during the height of pandemic cancellations in 2020.

“When we were trying to explain the background leading up to here, one of those mediators told us that that was just all baggage and that she didn’t want to hear about it,” Van Os said.

“They want a mediator so badly, that they must think that a mediator will convince the union to agree to their demands,” he added.

‘Rocks in their head’
---

The Symphony Society charge further accuses the union of negotiating in bad faith, refusing to continue negotiations, and imposing conditions for a return to bargaining.

Van Os called the charge an attempt to deflect attention from the union’s earlier charge. “If they’re charging us in bad faith, they’ve got rocks in their head.”

The union has called for management to rescind the contract imposed on Sept. 26 before negotiations can continue. The contract matches management’s “last, best, final offer,” which reduces the number of full-time musicians in the orchestra from 71 to 42, fills 26 other positions with part-time musicians, and makes drastic wage cuts of 33% for full-timers and what union members have described as “poverty level” annual wages of $11,000 for part-timers.

Van Os said the two sides met last week for a grievance session outside the formal negotiations, and the union told management “if you will withdraw that [last, best, final offer] label … and if you will agree to rescind the unilaterally imposed conditions, we will be happy to come back to the bargaining table. But we’re not going to do it unless it’s on an equal playing field.”

Ferguson, once an attorney for the NLRB in the 1980s, said, “that’s not the way it works in bargaining. We’re not asking the union to call off their strike as a condition to return to the table.”

He said management might well be willing to move away from its last, best, final offer, but nothing can be determined until the two sides return to negotiations.

“We’ll consider all proposals … and hopefully arrive at some kind of mutually agreeable contract. Both sides are going to have to move — the Symphony realizes that they may have to move from their last best and final. … They may very well move. But we won’t know that until we get to the table and negotiate.”

The law is clear, Ferguson said. “You can’t condition bargaining.”

Ferguson said the imposed contract applies only to the third year of the original three-year contract negotiated in 2019 and does not bear on future contracts. But Van Os said agreeing to the imposed contract terms for even the remainder of the 2021-2022 season would prove disastrous for the symphony.

“We believe that we would never be able to get the symphony to get off of them if we agreed to them. They are completely intolerable. They will destroy the San Antonio symphony,” Van Os said. “And it looks to me like right now, the board is trying to destroy the symphony. This is their doing, and it will be their historical legacy.”",0,,,5570,0,1,1

- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps
- Hazard &amp; Police Reports

You could talk to TWC and see if they will take over the line.  They can cut it, strip for a new end, and it back to a splicer on their box.  That way, you can move the modem to your second room to hook up to your router.  From the second room, your can run one ethernet cable to your bedroom.  It's less intrusive than running three lines to the other room.  If they don't want to take it over, then you can inquire how much it would be to just add another drop.

If you're worried about aesthetics/cable management and want to stick to the original setup (running three lines to the second room instead), you might want to go to through the professional route.

1207,"Toll roads are safer to travel with high speeds because the majority of traffic is flowing at 1 speed. Because people who take the toll roads are literally paying to get places faster. 85mph is not safe when the majority of people around you are going 65. 

Guess what? Assume everyone in the left lane travels at 90mph and all the right lanes travel at 65mph. Eventually you’re going to have to get over and exit 9 times out of 10. When is it safe to merge into a lane that’s going 20-30 mph slower than you? Especially without drastically slowing down traffic in “the fast lane”. It doesn’t work. 

Automotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. That’s not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesn’t mean you’re immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldn’t be bothered to have just left earlier. 

I will say that there are some roads that are designed to have people driving at those higher speeds, the majority of San Antonio roads are not those roads.

1275,"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here.

By Richard Webner, Staff WriterAugust 4, 2016 Updated: August 4, 2016 11:04pm

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio’s City Council approved a request Thursday from the property’s current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

“It’s a brand with global cache, and it’s one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,” said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg’s office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla’s presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company’s electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer’s recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn’t respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

“It’s a corridor that’s accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,” Nirenberg said. It is “one of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.”

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of “Tesla in Texas,” which touts the company’s position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe’s cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

Then there's security cameras, which has to have internet service, so there's another $50/month.

And the street lamps need power, so does the gate, and the security cams, so that's another $50/month in electricity.

Then we've got to get the common area trees trimmed, but that has to be done by a certified arborist so that's another whatever the hell that costs.

The city needs to basically do everything within their power to attract Google here (especially for Google Fiber).  It needs to provide incentives for start-ups to call San Antonio home.  It needs to take advantage of technology that is going to change the world in the next 5-10 years.

There are so many opportunities for the city government to pursue but it equates bringing a company that will hire hundreds at low-paying jobs as success versus a company that will hire 30-50 but at much much higher wages.",,,,1238,0,1,1

Edit: Wanted to add that its not a ""scam"" exactly. It's just not a smart investment if you run the numbers.

I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. You’re still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels you’re using.

There was a problem, though. Duncan never agreed to be photographed holding the sign or to endorse Elder, an agent at Keller Williams in San Antonio.

Duncan now is suing Elder, Keller Williams and some other parties alleging misappropriation of the retired basketball player’s name and image. The suit, filed in Bexar County District Court on Friday, seeks unspecified financial and punitive damages.

“It was just so blatant and so shameless,” said Michael D. Bernard, a lawyer for Duncan and former San Antonio city attorney. “We don’t want people to think this is OK or that it goes unnoticed, because it doesn’t. There is a consequence to it.”

Elder referred questions to Jack Hawthorne, general counsel for Keller Williams in San Antonio. Hawthorne declined to comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.""",,,,1108,0,1,1

Note how she doesn’t utter one sentence accepting responsibility for her negligence. “Oh, my husband!” “Oh, my children!” Guess what. If you have dogs that act aggressively regardless of how you’ve bothered to train or treat them and still decide to keep them, ANY incident that occurs as a result of your dog is your fault. Period. I’m sick of the, “oh, I just made one mistake and this happened!” or “we were taking the steps recommended :(“ sob stories - if all it takes is a human slip-up for your dog to literally kill a person, you shouldn’t own the dog, and to be totally frank, your dog should not exist. 

Also, owner’s Facebook tells a radically different story. These dogs were ROUTINE escape artists, and yet no effort was ever made to modify that pathetic excuse for a fence. She addresses the attempts lazily and even appears to find them vaguely funny. She feels sad because she’s shunned by her neighbors? How many times do you think her neighbors came to her because they were being terrorized by her pack? How many times do you think she laughed at their concerns while defending her dogs claiming “they’re just the sweetest babes!” and “they wouldn’t hurt a fly!” It’s only fair she gets to feel one sliver of the discomfort that they felt.

My biggest concern lies with the fact their most aggressive dog (Snow, the white dog whose jaws are pink because of how much blood is on them) had NINE puppies. Nine pups directly descended from a genetically unstable killer monstrosity that need to be humanely destroyed before they reach maturity, and yet from the way that she speaks, it sounds like she’s already sold a decent amount of them. I seriously doubt their new owners will be informed of what exactly it is they own until it’s too late. More tragedy on the horizon. 

ACS also deserves a lawsuit, but husband deserves to be hit with the full brunt of his charges.

The baby wasn’t feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I’m an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I’ve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell.

What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word “baby”. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I’m not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn’t something I’m good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I’m so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children’s backpacks right next to it.

Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a “limb” had fallen. They also reported that the zoo’s EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn’t at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though.

I’m also the type of person who has to understand the “why’s” of things so I also Google (or whatever search engine you want) and watch YouTube videos on psychology that speak to what I would like to learn about. 

I started my journey by searching “why am I so angry” and found out about anxiety (I honestly had no idea what it was prior to about ~6 years ago) and then I learned about depression and those symptoms. It has been a tough road but I’m happy with the progress I made. There’s been plenty of ups and downs, breakdowns and outbursts and some of them were cathartic and necessary.

You can also call pizza and fast food places that are still open (call between 2-4pm) and ask if they are hiring but that’s less likely than HEB, Sprouts, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods.  You should also google JobCorps and find out if you can sign up for the next round, but of course that won’t be for awhile yet.

1916,"So far, I've used both Sprint and AT&amp;T, but I've only used Ma Bell with my iPhones; when I had Sprint, I had a Palm Treo which I used data on (slow tethering and pre iPhone browsing).

Sprint wasn't fast, but I mostly blame CDMA and the Treo; cell service was fantastic and I always had full bars. Customer service with Sprint is HORRIBLE, and one of the reasons I left (besides the 3GS).

If you're going 4S, I recommend AT&amp;T for HSPA+ (pseudo 4G, more like 3.5G). CDMA just isn't as good, and I have a feeling Sprint's network will be slower based on multiple reports I've looked at.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

Unlimited is great, so long as its usable. Just try out one and if you get bad service, return it while you can. If you're signing a contract; just get a 5. :)

So far, this is the most diplomatic Mod answer I've seen.

I understand Mods having personal lives. I don't have any responsibilities on reddit but I do moderate or own a few 10,000+ member groups on facebook and boy they're far busier than r/sanantonio and I can't always handle things right away.

But lets use the example of someone blocking a user who just creates a new account and comes in and trolls them all over again. The block/report feature is only, what, three or four mouse clicks?

I'd like to submit to you, Guac, that you guys consider disabling the automod for a month with the caveat that if things get out of hand, it gets reactivated.

1926,"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not. 

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things. 

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student. 

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice. 

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time. ",,,,3002,0,1,1

1943,"&gt;Hey, if it's already in place and there will not be any additional costs, use it. Why do you ask the question?

Because I don't understand why I should care about that. It may be free economically, but it would take political will to turn on, and that's political will that could be aimed at something more important than enabling some janitor at SAHA to stream seven pornos simultaneously while on the clock.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for. The ""digital divide"" isn't from people having access to cable speeds instead of fiber speeds. Some poor guy in the projects isn't failing to better himself because he doesn't have FIOS.

Let's be honest with ourselves: unless we're some big data engineer/scientist, we want faster Internet for ultraHD Game of Thrones streams and so we can pirate an episode of the Daily Show in two seconds off Usenet.

&gt;Do you think it should be metered

no

Go fuck yourself for even suggesting something so vile.

**Edit** OK I guess I admit it would be cool to be able to stream something from my home network to my in-laws' house in Houston the couple times a year I go visit or to upload my videos from Cornyation a few times faster than I currently do. But LOL at lack of access to gigabit Internet being some sort of economic hindrance.

I could get behind an argument saying poors only have access to dialup and we need to get them some kind of bandwidth, absolutely—that really is a digital divide. You can't do MOOCs, e.g., with dialup. But an upgrade from cable to fiber isn't going to give you a leg up in the economy, yet that's the argument I keep seeing people make.

I'm not against fiber. I'm against arguments I don't understand and arguments that are stupid. I don't know whether the economic argument is the former or the latter, which is why I'm asking the question; so I can decide whether I don't understand or whether it's just a stupid argument.",1,,,2138,0,1,1
1945,"Sorry if I was a bit too harsh - but db positions have typically been pretty competitive because the pay for a DB admins is usually pretty good.  Plus, every listing requires years of experience for even entry-level stuff - which I think they do out of pure sadism.  Then there's also the absurdly-specific-required-skill-set job listing, which is usually only done because they already know exactly who they want to hire/promote, but they need to list the job for bureaucratic reasons.  

As far as ""heavy programming requirements"" goes, what I mean is that DB management/building requires a high level of programming skill to do well.  SQL *is* a programming language, and the entire point of a DB is to work in tandem with other programs, usually requiring some API/scripting management.  Being familiar with programming concepts and dblibs in Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP is a *huge* part of the difference between a good DB admin and a terrible one.

In SA, your best best for db work will be with the bigger companies.  Rackspace and USAA are sucking up all the tech talent they can find, but it's hard to get a Resume thru the filters.
