The baby wasn’t feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I’m an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I’ve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell. It’s strange how your mind works when your senses are overwhelmed by adrenaline. I knew that we were far enough away that we were safe. I looked upwards to see if power lines were in the tree limbs and I jumped in front of the stroller to make sure the baby wouldn’t be injured by fleeing people. I also remember having the irrelevant thought that “it’s not even that windy”. When the tree actually impacted, it was chaos. I heard a woman screaming. What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word “baby”. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I’m not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn’t something I’m good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I’m so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children’s backpacks right next to it. I looked for a few more minutes and thankfully didn’t find anyone. As I navigated my way out, I administered another cursing over-you guessed it, power lines. This time to a guest who told me to stay away from them. If you’ve watched the video, I’m the guy with the  gray ponytail. It turned out, that the family who was injured, lives a few miles away from me. I don’t know them but the mother works in a school cafeteria. I mention this because that should make it obvious that she isn’t wealthy. If you can help, please do. There is a Go Fund Me page. I don’t want to invade the families privacy so you can find it on your own if you look. We left the zoo immediately afterwards. On the drive home I looked at the news. Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a “limb” had fallen. They also reported that the zoo’s EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn’t at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though. I hope that samples of the affected area of that tree were preserved and I hope that other guests got plenty of pics of the tree. I didn’t think to take any.",,,,2863,0,1,1,1,0

You can also call pizza and fast food places that are still open (call between 2-4pm) and ask if they are hiring but that’s less likely than HEB, Sprouts, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods.

Sprint wasn't fast, but I mostly blame CDMA and the Treo; cell service was fantastic and I always had full bars. Customer service with Sprint is HORRIBLE, and one of the reasons I left (besides the 3GS).

If you're going 4S, I recommend AT&amp;T for HSPA+ (pseudo 4G, more like 3.5G). CDMA just isn't as good, and I have a feeling Sprint's network will be slower based on multiple reports I've looked at.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

Unlimited is great, so long as its usable. Just try out one and if you get bad service, return it while you can. If you're signing a contract; just get a 5. :)

I asked if she was worried and she said, “No, the media hyped it up, its not as bad as they said.”

1926,"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not. 

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things. 

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student. 

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice. 

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time. ",,,,3002,0,1,1,1,0

The vendor that was doing them for Florida, provided them with a pamphlet for Martha’s Vineyard provided a map and the phone numbers for different services” - Ron de Santis. As you can clearly tell… he did not lie to them. This is indeed a well thought out political stunt. Here in Texas about 2 thousand people enter the border illegally every day. YTD this year so far is 1.9 million, that’s the whole population of San Antonio. Obviously we need help. The immigrants don’t warn us when they cross the border, we act accordingly. However when we send them to a different state also without warning, with far less than what we receive a day, everyone loses their mind.
Yes we are complaining, people in Brownsville (high percentage of hispanic population) complain they dont have the means to sustain, people in Uvalde (a small city with little resources) are also complaining. Small rural towns are being filled with massive numbers of illegal immigrants.
This brings me to my question, how is it bad to send migrants to places that actually want to take care of them and have a high amount of resources? Take responsibility in your words saying they are “welcomed”. Also isn’t it funny how in less than 48 hours they removed the immigrants from Martha’s Vineyard and sent them to a military base?

1943,"&gt;Hey, if it's already in place and there will not be any additional costs, use it. Why do you ask the question?

Because I don't understand why I should care about that. It may be free economically, but it would take political will to turn on, and that's political will that could be aimed at something more important than enabling some janitor at SAHA to stream seven pornos simultaneously while on the clock.

I'm all for faster Internet, but, I mean, my wife and I watch movies on Netflix non-stop, and my job is as lawyer for a tech company, and I don't get wtf the average person needs faster Internet than we already have for. The ""digital divide"" isn't from people having access to cable speeds instead of fiber speeds. Some poor guy in the projects isn't failing to better himself because he doesn't have FIOS.

Let's be honest with ourselves: unless we're some big data engineer/scientist, we want faster Internet for ultraHD Game of Thrones streams and so we can pirate an episode of the Daily Show in two seconds off Usenet.

&gt;Do you think it should be metered

no

&gt;Do you work for Time Warner, Comcast? 

Go fuck yourself for even suggesting something so vile.

**Edit** OK I guess I admit it would be cool to be able to stream something from my home network to my in-laws' house in Houston the couple times a year I go visit or to upload my videos from Cornyation a few times faster than I currently do. But LOL at lack of access to gigabit Internet being some sort of economic hindrance.

I could get behind an argument saying poors only have access to dialup and we need to get them some kind of bandwidth, absolutely—that really is a digital divide. You can't do MOOCs, e.g., with dialup. But an upgrade from cable to fiber isn't going to give you a leg up in the economy, yet that's the argument I keep seeing people make.

I'm not against fiber. I'm against arguments I don't understand and arguments that are stupid. I don't know whether the economic argument is the former or the latter, which is why I'm asking the question; so I can decide whether I don't understand or whether it's just a stupid argument.",,,,2138,0,1,1,1,0

1945,"Sorry if I was a bit too harsh - but db positions have typically been pretty competitive because the pay for a DB admins is usually pretty good.  Plus, every listing requires years of experience for even entry-level stuff - which I think they do out of pure sadism.  Then there's also the absurdly-specific-required-skill-set job listing, which is usually only done because they already know exactly who they want to hire/promote, but they need to list the job for bureaucratic reasons.  

As far as ""heavy programming requirements"" goes, what I mean is that DB management/building requires a high level of programming skill to do well.  SQL *is* a programming language, and the entire point of a DB is to work in tandem with other programs, usually requiring some API/scripting management.  Being familiar with programming concepts and dblibs in Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP is a *huge* part of the difference between a good DB admin and a terrible one.

In SA, your best best for db work will be with the bigger companies.  Rackspace and USAA are sucking up all the tech talent they can find, but it's hard to get a Resume thru the filters.  I think HostGator is in a bit of a hiring freeze, but if you know any Linux, then they'll probably at least give you an interview.  The school districts usually have open IT positions, General Dynamics has some IT here in town, and Accenture has cold called me an annoying amount of times for some entry level stuff, but the pay they offer is an insult.
