1663,"Hey good luck with your store man. One tip I can give you and this could literally make or break alot of business: pay someone to design/maintain a website. Especially with all this tech you guys are offering, I'd look at forking over a few thousand just for branding and a website.

I'll be frank and say that if I had never physically been to your store before, yet was interested, but saw that website, I probably wouldn't come.  I know guys are in the beginning stages but an online presence (or lack of) can either destroy you or be a blessing. Also pay a designer for a new logo!

1689,"Wife should be charged with murder as well, but I suppose that somebody has to watch over her children. Note how she doesn’t utter one sentence accepting responsibility for her negligence. “Oh, my husband!” “Oh, my children!” Guess what. If you have dogs that act aggressively regardless of how you’ve bothered to train or treat them and still decide to keep them, ANY incident that occurs as a result of your dog is your fault. Period. I’m sick of the, “oh, I just made one mistake and this happened!” or “we were taking the steps recommended :(“ sob stories - if all it takes is a human slip-up for your dog to literally kill a person, you shouldn’t own the dog, and to be totally frank, your dog should not exist. 

Also, owner’s Facebook tells a radically different story. These dogs were ROUTINE escape artists, and yet no effort was ever made to modify that pathetic excuse for a fence. She addresses the attempts lazily and even appears to find them vaguely funny. She feels sad because she’s shunned by her neighbors? How many times do you think her neighbors came to her because they were being terrorized by her pack? How many times do you think she laughed at their concerns while defending her dogs claiming “they’re just the sweetest babes!” and “they wouldn’t hurt a fly!” It’s only fair she gets to feel one sliver of the discomfort that they felt.

My biggest concern lies with the fact their most aggressive dog (Snow, the white dog whose jaws are pink because of how much blood is on them) had NINE puppies. Nine pups directly descended from a genetically unstable killer monstrosity that need to be humanely destroyed before they reach maturity, and yet from the way that she speaks, it sounds like she’s already sold a decent amount of them. I seriously doubt their new owners will be informed of what exactly it is they own until it’s too late. More tragedy on the horizon. 

ACS also deserves a lawsuit, but husband deserves to be hit with the full brunt of his charges. Make an example of him so that maybe, finally, people will be forced to take responsibility for their aggressive dogs. Years of doing nothing or fining the owners pathetic fees have led to this tragedy occurring.",,,,2205,0,1,1,1,0

I don’t know that Los Angeles should be your go-to example. I’m not saying transit is a magic bullet but it’s logical that diversifying transportation options would be helpful. At least in my mind, isn’t making everyone drive a personal vehicle in order to go anywhere akin to government mandated car ownership? Can’t hold a job, go to school, shop, live unless you can travel to those places. 

Transportation is just the tip of the iceberg though. Transit fails for any number of reasons, but the top may as we’ll be that our preferred urban development patterns can’t support it.

Make my way to the fridge for my insulin shot before going out to Las Palapas for 4 bean and cheese tacos and a Diet Coke.

1805,"I go to Dr Harle at Seven Oaks Women's Center and love it there. I believe they have multiple locations. It's very clean, professional, has good quality doctors, and when I had issues with my birth control I was able to contact them through a web portal and they were quick about answering my questions and giving me the next steps quickly. This was a nice option for me since it's hard for me to take calls while I'm at work and I usually end up playing phone tag with doctors.",,,,478,0,0,1,1,0

1817,"I dont know man, I've looked around a bit. All the decent jobs I see want a degree of some sort. Some of them just want an associates, but the majority of the good ones want bachelors.  
  
I even have some IT experience, 3 years as the sole person responsible for computers and network at a medium side local business. But without the degree all I can find are other relatively small local businesses that dont want to pay much.  
  
I've returned to school, going to get a CS degree and hopefully land a job with the city (Know a few people who work there, should help land a job once I meet the minimum qualifications).  
  
If you can pull off getting even just an associates at Alamo colleges, that'd probably help your prospects significantly. The city has some decent jobs come up from time to time. And I'm sure they arent the only ones.  
  
Also, look into getting a CCNA, I hear that cert alone can yield some good money.",,,,932,0,0,1,1,0

The opposite of that is those that dig their heels in on whatever meme they saw in their Facebook echo chamber.
